GSH Builtins
============

Contrary to other shell implementations, GSH tries to provide UNIX commands as
builtins. There are two categories of builtins:

* special-builtins: commands that due to their interaction with the shell
  must be implemented as a builtin.

* other builtings: commands that are both available as builtin in GSH and as
  external commands as commodity.
