NAME
       od - dump files in octal and other formats

SYNOPSIS
       od [OPTION]... [FILE]...
       od [-abcdfilosx]... [FILE] [[+]OFFSET[.][b]]
       od  --traditional  [OPTION]...  [FILE]  [[+]OFFSET[.][b]
       [+][LABEL][.][b]]

DESCRIPTION
       Write an  unambiguous  representation,  octal  bytes  by
       default, of FILE to standard output.  With more than one
       FILE argument, concatenate them in the listed  order  to
       form  the  input.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read
       standard input.

       All arguments to long options are  mandatory  for  short
       options.

       -A, --address-radix=RADIX
              decide how file offsets are printed

       -j, --skip-bytes=BYTES
              skip BYTES input bytes first

       -N, --read-bytes=BYTES
              limit dump to BYTES input bytes

       -S, --strings[=BYTES]
              output strings of at least BYTES graphic chars

       -t, --format=TYPE
              select output format or formats

       -v, --output-duplicates
              do not use * to mark line suppression

       -w, --width[=BYTES]
              output BYTES bytes per output line

       --traditional
              accept arguments in traditional form

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

   Traditional  format  specifications  may be intermixed; they
       accumulate:
       -a     same as -t a,  select named characters

       -b     same as -t o1, select octal bytes

       -c     same as -t c,  select ASCII characters  or  back-
              slash escapes

       -d     same  as  -t  u2,  select unsigned decimal 2-byte
              units

       -f     same as -t fF, select floats

       -i     same as -t dI, select decimal ints

       -l     same as -t dL, select decimal longs

       -o     same as -t o2, select octal 2-byte units

       -s     same as -t d2, select decimal 2-byte units

       -x     same as -t x2, select hexadecimal 2-byte units

       If first and second call formats both apply, the  second
       format  is  assumed if the last operand begins with + or
       (if there are 2 operands) a digit.   An  OFFSET  operand
       means  -j  OFFSET.  LABEL is the pseudo-address at first
       byte printed, incremented when dump is progressing.  For
       OFFSET  and LABEL, a 0x or 0X prefix indicates hexadeci-
       mal; suffixes may be . for octal and b for  multiply  by
       512.

       TYPE is made up of one or more of these specifications:

       a      named character

       c      ASCII character or backslash escape

       d[SIZE]
              signed decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       f[SIZE]
              floating point, SIZE bytes per integer

       o[SIZE]
              octal, SIZE bytes per integer

       u[SIZE]
              unsigned decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       x[SIZE]
              hexadecimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       SIZE  is a number.  For TYPE in doux, SIZE may also be C
       for sizeof(char), S for sizeof(short), I for sizeof(int)
       or L for sizeof(long).  If TYPE is f, SIZE may also be F
       for  sizeof(float),  D  for  sizeof(double)  or  L   for
       sizeof(long double).

       RADIX  is  d for decimal, o for octal, x for hexadecimal
       or n for none.  BYTES is hexadecimal with 0x or 0X  pre-
       fix, it is multiplied by 512 with b suffix, by 1024 with
       k and by 1048576 with m.  Adding a z suffix to any  type
       adds  a  display  of  printable characters to the end of
       each line of output.  --string without a number  implies
       3.  --width without a number implies 32.  By default, od
       uses -A o -t d2 -w 16.
