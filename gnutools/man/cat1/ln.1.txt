NAME
       ln - make links between files

SYNOPSIS
       ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME   (1st form)
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET                  (2nd form)
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY     (3rd form)
       ln [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY TARGET...  (4th form)

DESCRIPTION
       In  the  1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name
       LINK_NAME.  In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET  in
       the current directory.  In the 3rd and 4th forms, create
       links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.  Create hard links by
       default,  symbolic links with --symbolic.  When creating
       hard links, each TARGET must exist.

       Mandatory arguments to long options  are  mandatory  for
       short options too.

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       -d, -F, --directory
              allow  the  superuser  to  attempt  to  hard link
              directories (note: will probably fail due to sys-
              tem restrictions, even for the superuser)

       -f, --force
              remove existing destination files

       -n, --no-dereference
              treat  destination  that is a symlink to a direc-
              tory as if it were a normal file

       -i, --interactive
              prompt whether to remove destinations

       -s, --symbolic
              make symbolic links instead of hard links

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              specify the DIRECTORY  in  which  to  create  the
              links

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat LINK_NAME as a normal file

       -v, --verbose
              print name of each file before linking

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  backup  suffix  is `~', unless set with --suffix or
       SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be
       selected   via   the  --backup  option  or  through  the
       VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the val-
       ues:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple other-
              wise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups
