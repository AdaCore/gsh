       dard input, writing to standard output.

       -c, -C, --complement
              first complement SET1

       -d, --delete
              delete characters in SET1, do not translate

       -s, --squeeze-repeats
              replace each input sequence of a repeated charac-
              ter  that  is listed in SET1 with a single occur-
              rence of that character

       -t, --truncate-set1
              first truncate SET1 to length of SET2

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SETs are specified as strings of characters.  Most  rep-
       resent themselves.  Interpreted sequences are:

       \NNN   character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal dig-
              its)

       \\     backslash

       \a     audible BEL

       \b     backspace

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab

       CHAR1-CHAR2
              all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2  in  ascending
              order

       [CHAR*]
              in SET2, copies of CHAR until length of SET1

       [CHAR*REPEAT]
              REPEAT  copies  of CHAR, REPEAT octal if starting
              with 0

       [:alnum:]
              all letters and digits

       [:alpha:]
              all letters

       [:blank:]
              all horizontal whitespace

       [:cntrl:]
              all control characters

       [:digit:]
              all digits

       [:graph:]
              all printable characters, not including space

       [:lower:]
              all lower case letters

       [:print:]
              all printable characters, including space

       [:punct:]
              all punctuation characters

       [:space:]
              all horizontal or vertical whitespace

       [:upper:]
              all upper case letters

       [:xdigit:]
              all hexadecimal digits

       [=CHAR=]
              all characters which are equivalent to CHAR

       Translation occurs if -d is not given and both SET1  and
       SET2  appear.   -t  may  be  used only when translating.
       SET2 is extended to length of SET1 by repeating its last
       character  as  necessary.  Excess characters of SET2 are
       ignored.  Only [:lower:] and [:upper:] are guaranteed to
       expand  in ascending order; used in SET2 while translat-
       ing, they may only be used in pairs to specify case con-
       version.   -s uses SET1 if not translating nor deleting;
       else squeezing uses SET2 and occurs after translation or
       deletion.
