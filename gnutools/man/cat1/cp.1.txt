NAME
       cp - copy files and directories

SYNOPSIS
       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory arguments to long options  are  mandatory  for
       short options too.

       -a, --archive
              same as -dpR

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       --copy-contents
              copy contents of special files when recursive

       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=link

       --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links

       -f, --force
              if an existing destination file cannot be opened,
              remove it and try again

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links

       -l, --link
              link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links

       -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps

       --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
              preserve  the  specified   attributes   (default:
              mode,ownership,timestamps),   if  possible  addi-
              tional attributes: links, all

       --no-preserve=ATTR_LIST
              don't preserve the specified attributes

       --parents
              append source path to DIRECTORY

       -P     same as `--no-dereference'

       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       --remove-destination
              remove  each  existing  destination  file  before
              attempting to open it (contrast with --force)

       --reply={yes,no,query}
              specify  how to handle the prompt about an exist-
              ing destination file

       --sparse=WHEN
              control creation of sparse files

       --strip-trailing-slashes  remove  any  trailing  slashes
       from each SOURCE
              argument

       -s, --symbolic-link
              make symbolic links instead of copying

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -u, --update
              copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than  the
              destination  file or when the destination file is
              missing

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -x, --one-file-system
              stay on this file system

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, sparse SOURCE files are detected by a  crude
       heuristic and the corresponding DEST file is made sparse
       as   well.    That   is   the   behavior   selected   by
       --sparse=auto.   Specify  --sparse=always  to  create  a
       sparse DEST file whenever the  SOURCE  file  contains  a
       long  enough sequence of zero bytes.  Use --sparse=never
       to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       The backup suffix is `~', unless set  with  --suffix  or
       SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be
       selected via the --backup option  or  through  the  VER-
       SION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple other-
              wise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As  a special case, cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the
       force and backup options are given and SOURCE  and  DEST
       are the same name for an existing, regular file.
