NAME
       du - estimate file space usage

SYNOPSIS
       du [OPTION]... [FILE]...
       du [OPTION]... --files0-from=F

DESCRIPTION
       Summarize  disk  usage  of  each  FILE,  recursively for
       directories.

       Mandatory arguments to long options  are  mandatory  for
       short options too.

       -a, --all
              write counts for all files, not just directories

       --apparent-size
              print  apparent  sizes,  rather  than disk usage;
              although the apparent size is usually smaller, it
              may  be  larger due to holes in (`sparse') files,
              internal fragmentation, indirect blocks, and  the
              like

       -B, --block-size=SIZE use SIZE-byte blocks

       -b, --bytes
              equivalent to `--apparent-size --block-size=1'

       -c, --total
              produce a grand total

       -D, --dereference-args
              dereference FILEs that are symbolic links

       --files0-from=F
              summarize  disk  usage of the NUL-terminated file
              names specified in file F

       -H     like --si, but also evokes a warning;  will  soon
              change  to  be  equivalent  to --dereference-args
              (-D)

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in human readable  format  (e.g.,  1K
              234M 2G)

       --si   like -h, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

       -k     like --block-size=1K

       -l, --count-links
              count sizes many times if hard linked

       -L, --dereference
              dereference all symbolic links

       -P, --no-dereference
              don't  follow  any  symbolic  links  (this is the
              default)

       -0, --null
              end each output line with 0 byte rather than new-
              line

       -S, --separate-dirs
              do not include size of subdirectories

       -s, --summarize
              display only a total for each argument

       -x, --one-file-system
              skip directories on different file systems

       -X FILE, --exclude-from=FILE
              Exclude files that match any pattern in FILE.

       --exclude=PATTERN Exclude files that match PATTERN.

       --max-depth=N
              print  the  total  for a directory (or file, with
              --all) only if it is N or fewer levels below  the
              command line argument;  --max-depth=0 is the same
              as --summarize

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SIZE may be (or may be an  integer  optionally  followed
       by)  one  of following: kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M
       1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.

PATTERNS
       PATTERN is a shell pattern (not a  regular  expression).
       The  pattern  ?   matches  any  one character, whereas *
       matches any string (composed of zero,  one  or  multiple
       characters).   For  example,  *.o  will  match any files
       whose names end in .o.  Therefore, the command

              du --exclude='*.o'

       will skip all files  and  subdirectories  ending  in  .o
       (including the file .o itself).
