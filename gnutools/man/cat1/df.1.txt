NAME
       df - report file system disk space usage

SYNOPSIS
       df [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of df.  df
       displays the amount of disk space available on the  file
       system  containing  each file name argument.  If no file
       name is given, the  space  available  on  all  currently
       mounted  file  systems is shown.  Disk space is shown in
       1K blocks by default, unless  the  environment  variable
       POSIXLY_CORRECT  is  set,  in which case 512-byte blocks
       are used.

       If an argument is the  absolute  file  name  of  a  disk
       device  node  containing a mounted file system, df shows
       the space available on that file system rather  than  on
       the  file  system  containing  the device node (which is
       always the root file system).  This version of df cannot
       show  the  space  available  on  unmounted file systems,
       because on most kinds of systems doing so requires  very
       nonportable  intimate  knowledge  of  file system struc-
       tures.

OPTIONS
       Show information about the file  system  on  which  each
       FILE resides, or all file systems by default.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long options are mandatory for
       short options too.

       -a, --all
              include file systems having 0 blocks

       -B, --block-size=SIZE use SIZE-byte blocks

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in human readable  format  (e.g.,  1K
              234M 2G)

       -H, --si
              likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

       -i, --inodes
              list inode information instead of block usage

       -k     like --block-size=1K

       -l, --local
              limit listing to local file systems

       --no-sync
              do  not  invoke  sync  before  getting usage info
              (default)

       -P, --portability
              use the POSIX output format

       --sync invoke sync before getting usage info

       -t, --type=TYPE
              limit listing to file systems of type TYPE

       -T, --print-type
              print file system type

       -x, --exclude-type=TYPE
              limit listing to file systems not of type TYPE

       -v     (ignored)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SIZE may be (or may be an  integer  optionally  followed
       by)  one  of following: kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M
       1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.
