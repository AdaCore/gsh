NAME
       chgrp - change group ownership

SYNOPSIS
       chgrp [OPTION]... GROUP FILE...
       chgrp [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Change  the  group of each FILE to GROUP.  With --refer-
       ence, change the group of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only  when  a  change  is
              made

       --dereference
              affect the referent of each symbolic link, rather
              than  the  symbolic  link  itself  (this  is  the
              default)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect  each  symbolic link instead of any refer-
              enced file  (useful  only  on  systems  that  can
              change the ownership of a symlink)

       --no-preserve-root  do  not  treat  `/'  specially  (the
              default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on `/'

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's  group  rather  than  the  specifying
              GROUP value

       -R, --recursive
              operate on files and directories recursively

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       The  following  options  modify  how a hierarchy is tra-
       versed when the -R option is also  specified.   If  more
       than  one is specified, only the final one takes effect.

       -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link  to
              a directory, traverse it

       -L     traverse  every  symbolic  link  to  a  directory
              encountered

       -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit
