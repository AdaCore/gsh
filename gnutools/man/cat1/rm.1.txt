NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of rm.  rm
       removes each specified file.  By default,  it  does  not
       remove directories.

       If  a  file  is unwritable, the standard input is a tty,
       and the -f or --force option is not  given,  rm  prompts
       the  user  for  whether  to  remove  the  file.   If the
       response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -d, --directory
              unlink FILE, even if it is a non-empty  directory
              (super-user only; this works only if your system

              supports `unlink' for nonempty directories)

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files, never prompt

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before any removal

       --no-preserve-root  do  not  treat  `/'  specially  (the
              default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on `/'

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove the contents of directories recursively

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       To remove a file whose name starts with a `-', for exam-
       ple `-foo', use one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note  that if you use rm to remove a file, it is usually
       possible to recover the contents of that file.   If  you
       want more assurance that the contents are truly unrecov-
       erable, consider using shred.
