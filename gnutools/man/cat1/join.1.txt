NAME
       join - join lines of two files on a common field

SYNOPSIS
       join [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

DESCRIPTION
       For each pair of input lines with identical join fields,
       write a line to standard output.  The default join field
       is  the  first,  delimited by whitespace.  When FILE1 or
       FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard input.

       -a FILENUM
              print unpairable lines coming from file  FILENUM,
              where  FILENUM  is 1 or 2, corresponding to FILE1
              or FILE2

       -e EMPTY
              replace missing input fields with EMPTY

       -i, --ignore-case ignore differences in case  when  com-
              paring fields

       -j FIELD
              equivalent to `-1 FIELD -2 FIELD'

       -o FORMAT
              obey FORMAT while constructing output line

       -t CHAR
              use CHAR as input and output field separator

       -v FILENUM
              like -a FILENUM, but suppress joined output lines

       -1 FIELD
              join on this FIELD of file 1

       -2 FIELD
              join on this FIELD of file 2

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Unless -t CHAR is given, leading blanks separate  fields
       and are ignored, else fields are separated by CHAR.  Any
       FIELD is a field number counted from 1.  FORMAT  is  one
       or  more  comma  or blank separated specifications, each
       being `FILENUM.FIELD' or `0'.   Default  FORMAT  outputs
       the  join  field,  the  remaining fields from FILE1, the
       remaining fields from FILE2, all separated by CHAR.

       Important: FILE1 and FILE2 must be sorted  on  the  join
       fields.
