NAME
       igawk - gawk with include files

SYNOPSIS
       igawk  [  all gawk options ] -f program-file [ -- ] file
       ...

DESCRIPTION
       Igawk  is a simple shell script that adds the ability to
       have ``include files'' to gawk(1).

       AWK programs for igawk are the same as for gawk,  except
       that, in addition, you may have lines like

              @include getopt.awk

       in  your  program  to  include  the file getopt.awk from
       either the current directory or one of the other  direc-
       tories in the search path.

OPTIONS
       See  gawk(1)  for a full description of the AWK language
       and the options that gawk supports.

EXAMPLES
       cat << EOF > test.awk
       @include getopt.awk

       BEGIN {
            while (getopt(ARGC, ARGV, "am:q") != -1)
                 ...
       }
       EOF

       igawk -f test.awk
