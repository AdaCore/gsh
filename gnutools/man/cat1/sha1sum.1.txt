NAME
       sha1sum - compute and check SHA1 message digest

SYNOPSIS
       sha1sum [OPTION] [FILE]...
       sha1sum [OPTION] --check [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Print  or check SHA1 (160-bit) checksums.  With no FILE,
       or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read files in binary mode  (default  on  DOS/Win-
              dows)

       -c, --check
              check SHA1 sums against given list

       -t, --text
              read files in text mode (default)

   The  following  two  options  are useful only when verifying
       checksums:
       --status
              don't output anything, status code shows success

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formated checksum lines

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-1.   When
       checking,  the  input  should be a former output of this
       program.  The default mode  is  to  print  a  line  with
       checksum, a character indicating type (`*' for binary, `
       ' for text), and name for each FILE.
