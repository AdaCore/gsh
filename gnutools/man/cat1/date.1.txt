       %Z     time zone (e.g., EDT), or nothing if no time zone
              is determinable

       By  default,  date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  GNU
       date recognizes the following modifiers between `%'  and
       a numeric directive.

              `-'  (hyphen)  do  not  pad the field `_' (under-
              score) pad the field with spaces
