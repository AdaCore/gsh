NAME
       stty - change and print terminal line settings

SYNOPSIS
       stty [-F DEVICE] [--file=DEVICE] [SETTING]...
       stty [-F DEVICE] [--file=DEVICE] [-a|--all]
       stty [-F DEVICE] [--file=DEVICE] [-g|--save]

DESCRIPTION
       Print or change terminal characteristics.

       -a, --all
              print all current settings in human-readable form

       -g, --save
              print all current  settings  in  a  stty-readable
              form

       -F, --file=DEVICE
              open  and  use  the  specified  DEVICE instead of
              stdin

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Optional - before  SETTING  indicates  negation.   An  *
       marks non-POSIX settings.  The underlying system defines
       which settings are available.

       Handle the tty line connected to standard input.   With-
       out  arguments,  prints  baud rate, line discipline, and
       deviations from stty sane.  In settings, CHAR  is  taken
       literally, or coded as in ^c, 0x37, 0177 or 127; special
       values ^- or undef used to disable special characters.
