NAME
       nohup - invoke a utility immune to hangups

SYNOPSIS
       nohup utility [argument...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  nohup utility shall invoke the utility named by the
       utility operand with arguments supplied as the  argument
       operands.  At the time the named utility is invoked, the
       SIGHUP signal shall be set to be ignored.

       If the standard output is a terminal, all output written
       by  the  named  utility  to its standard output shall be
       appended to the end of the file nohup.out in the current
       directory.  If nohup.out cannot be created or opened for
       appending, the output shall be appended to  the  end  of
       the  file  nohup.out  in  the directory specified by the
       HOME environment variable. If neither file can  be  cre-
       ated  or  opened  for  appending,  utility  shall not be
       invoked. If a file is  created,  the  file's  permission
       bits shall be set to S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR.

       If  the standard error is a terminal, all output written
       by the named utility to  its  standard  error  shall  be
       redirected  to  the same file descriptor as the standard
       output.

OPTIONS
       None.

OPERANDS
       The following operands shall be supported:

       utility
              The name of a utility that is to be  invoked.  If
              the  utility  operand  names  any  of the special
              built-in utilities in Special Built-In  Utilities
              , the results are undefined.

       argument
              Any  string  to  be  supplied as an argument when
              invoking the utility named by the  utility  oper-
              and.


STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  following  environment  variables  shall affect the
       execution of nohup:

       HOME   Determine the pathname of the user's home  direc-
              tory: if the output file nohup.out cannot be cre-
              ated in the current directory, the nohup  utility
              shall  use  the directory named by HOME to create
              the file.

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion  variables  that are unset or null. (See the
              Base Definitions volume of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section  8.2,  Internationalization Variables for
              the precedence of internationalization  variables
              used  to  determine  the  values  of locale cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override  the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine the locale for  the  interpretation  of
              sequences  of  bytes  of  text data as characters
              (for example, single-byte as  opposed  to  multi-
              byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine  the  location  of message catalogs for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .

       PATH   Determine the search path that is used to  locate
              the  utility  to be invoked. See the Base Defini-
              tions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter  8,
              Environment Variables.


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       The nohup utility shall take the standard action for all
       signals except that SIGHUP shall be ignored.

STDOUT
       If the standard output is not a terminal,  the  standard
       output  of  nohup shall be the standard output generated
       by the execution of the utility specified by  the  oper-
       ands.  Otherwise,  nothing shall be written to the stan-
       dard output.

STDERR
       If the standard output is a terminal, a message shall be
       written  to  the  standard error, indicating the name of
       the file to which the output is being appended. The name
       of    the    file   shall   be   either   nohup.out   or
       $HOME/nohup.out.

OUTPUT FILES
       If the standard output is a terminal, all output written
       by the named utility to the standard output and standard
       error is appended to the file nohup.out, which  is  cre-
       ated if it does not already exist.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

       126    The  utility  specified  by utility was found but
              could not be invoked.

       127    An error occurred in the  nohup  utility  or  the
              utility  specified by utility could not be found.


       Otherwise, the exit status of nohup shall be that of the
       utility specified by the utility operand.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The command, env, nice, nohup, time, and xargs utilities
       have been specified to use exit code  127  if  an  error
       occurs  so that applications can distinguish "failure to
       find a utility" from "invoked  utility  exited  with  an
       error  indication".  The value 127 was chosen because it
       is not commonly used for other meanings; most  utilities
       use  small  values for "normal error conditions" and the
       values above 128 can be confused with termination due to
       receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen in a simi-
       lar manner to indicate that the utility could be  found,
       but  not  invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error
       messages differentiating the 126 and 127 cases. The dis-
       tinction  between  exit  codes  126  and 127 is based on
       KornShell practice that uses 127 when  all  attempts  to
       exec  the  utility fail with [ENOENT], and uses 126 when
       any attempt to exec the utility fails for any other rea-
       son.

EXAMPLES
       It  is  frequently desirable to apply nohup to pipelines
       or lists of commands. This can be done by placing  pipe-
       lines  and command lists in a single file; this file can
       then be invoked as a utility, and the nohup  applies  to
       everything in the file.

       Alternatively,  the  following  command  can  be used to
       apply nohup to a complex command:


              nohup sh -c 'complex-command-line'

RATIONALE
       The 4.3 BSD version ignores SIGTERM and SIGHUP,  and  if
       ./nohup.out  cannot  be used, it fails instead of trying
       to use $HOME/nohup.out.

       The csh utility has a built-in  version  of  nohup  that
       acts  differently  from the nohup defined in this volume
       of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.

       The term utility is used, rather than command, to  high-
       light  the fact that shell compound commands, pipelines,
       special built-ins, and so on, cannot be  used  directly.
       However,  utility includes user application programs and
       shell scripts, not just the standard utilities.

       Historical versions of the  nohup  utility  use  default
       file  creation  semantics. Some more recent versions use
       the permissions specified here as an added security pre-
       caution.

       Some  historical implementations ignore SIGQUIT in addi-
       tion to SIGHUP; others ignore SIGTERM. An early proposal
       allowed,  but  did  not  require, SIGQUIT to be ignored.
       Several reviewers objected that nohup should only modify
       the  handling  of  SIGHUP  as required by this volume of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.
