NAME
       tee - duplicate standard input

SYNOPSIS
       tee [-ai][file...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  tee  utility  shall copy standard input to standard
       output, making a copy in zero or  more  files.  The  tee
       utility shall not buffer output.

       If the -a option is not specified, output files shall be
       written (see File Read, Write, and Creation .

OPTIONS
       The tee utility shall conform to  the  Base  Definitions
       volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section 12.2, Utility
       Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -a     Append the output to the files.

       -i     Ignore the SIGINT signal.


OPERANDS
       The following operands shall be supported:

       file   A pathname of an output file.  Processing  of  at
              least 13 file operands shall be supported.


STDIN
       The standard input can be of any type.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  following  environment  variables  shall affect the
       execution of tee:

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion  variables  that are unset or null. (See the
              Base Definitions volume of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section  8.2,  Internationalization Variables for
              the precedence of internationalization  variables
              used  to  determine  the  values  of locale cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override  the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine the locale for  the  interpretation  of
              sequences  of  bytes  of  text data as characters
              (for example, single-byte as  opposed  to  multi-
              byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used to
              affect the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
              messages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine  the  location  of message catalogs for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default, except that if the  -i  option  was  specified,
       SIGINT shall be ignored.

STDOUT
       The  standard  output  shall  be  a copy of the standard
       input.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be  used  only  for  diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       If  any  file operands are specified, the standard input
       shall be copied to each named file.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     The standard input was successfully copied to all
              output files.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       If  a  write  to  any  successfully  opened file operand
       fails, writes to other successfully opened file operands
       and  standard output shall continue, but the exit status
       shall be non-zero.  Otherwise, the default actions spec-
       ified in Utility Description Defaults apply.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The tee utility is usually used in a pipeline, to make a
       copy of the output of some utility.

       The file operand is technically optional, but tee is  no
       more useful than cat when none is specified.

EXAMPLES
       Save  an  unsorted  intermediate  form  of the data in a
       pipeline:


              ... | tee unsorted | sort > sorted

RATIONALE
       The buffering requirement means that tee is not  allowed
       to  use  ISO C  standard fully buffered or line-buffered
       writes. It does not mean that tee has to do 1-byte reads
       followed by 1-byte writes.

       It should be noted that early versions of BSD ignore any
       invalid options and accept a single '-' as  an  alterna-
       tive  to -i. They also print a message if unable to open
       a file:


              "tee: cannot access %s\n", <pathname>

       Historical implementations ignore write errors. This  is
       explicitly    not    permitted   by   this   volume   of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.

       Some historical implementations use O_APPEND  when  pro-
       viding  append  mode; others use the lseek() function to
       seek to the end-of-file after opening the  file  without
       O_APPEND.  This  volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires
       functionality equivalent to  using  O_APPEND;  see  File
       Read, Write, and Creation .

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
