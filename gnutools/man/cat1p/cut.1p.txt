NAME
       cut - cut out selected fields of each line of a file

SYNOPSIS
       cut -b list [-n] [file ...]

       cut -c list [file ...]

       cut -f list [-d delim][-s][file ...]


DESCRIPTION
       The  cut utility shall cut out bytes ( -b option), char-
       acters ( -c option), or character-delimited fields (  -f
       option) from each line in one or more files, concatenate
       them, and write them to standard output.

OPTIONS
       The cut utility shall conform to  the  Base  Definitions
       volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section 12.2, Utility
       Syntax Guidelines.

       The application shall ensure  that  the  option-argument
       list (see options -b, -c, and -f below) is a comma-sepa-
       rated list or <blank>-separated list of positive numbers
       and  ranges.  Ranges can be in three forms. The first is
       two positive numbers separated by a hyphen ( low- high),
       which represents all fields from the first number to the
       second number. The second is a positive number  preceded
       by  a  hyphen (- high), which represents all fields from
       field number 1 to that number. The third is  a  positive
       number  followed  by  a hyphen ( low-), which represents
       that number to the last field, inclusive.  The  elements
       in  list can be repeated, can overlap, and can be speci-
       fied in any order, but the bytes, characters, or  fields
       selected  shall  be  written  in  the order of the input
       data.  If an element appears in the selection list  more
       than once, it shall be written exactly once.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -b  list
              Cut  based on a list of bytes. Each selected byte
              shall be output unless  the  -n  option  is  also
              specified.  It  shall  not  be an error to select
              bytes not present in the input line.

       -c  list
              Cut based on a list of characters. Each  selected
              character  shall  be  output.  It shall not be an
              error to select characters  not  present  in  the
              input line.

       -d  delim
              Set  the  field delimiter to the character delim.
              The default is the <tab>.

       -f  list
              Cut based on a list of fields, assumed to be sep-
              arated  in the file by a delimiter character (see
              -d). Each selected field shall be output.  Output
              fields  shall be separated by a single occurrence
              of the field delimiter character. Lines  with  no
              field  delimiters shall be passed through intact,
              unless -s is specified. It shall not be an  error
              to select fields not present in the input line.

       -n     Do  not split characters. When specified with the
              -b option, each element in list of the form  low-
              high (hyphen-separated numbers) shall be modified
              as follows:

              If the byte selected by low is not the first byte
              of  a  character,  low  shall  be  decremented to
              select the first byte of the character originally
              selected  by low. If the byte selected by high is
              not the last byte of a character, high  shall  be
              decremented  to select the last byte of the char-
              acter prior to the character originally  selected
              by  high, or zero if there is no prior character.
              If the resulting range element has high equal  to
              zero  or  low greater than high, the list element
              shall be dropped from list for  that  input  line
              without causing an error.

       Each  element  in list of the form low- shall be treated
       as above with high set to the number  of  bytes  in  the
       current  line,  not including the terminating <newline>.
       Each element in list of the form - high shall be treated
       as  above with low set to 1. Each element in list of the
       form num (a single number) shall  be  treated  as  above
       with low set to num and high set to num.

       -s     Suppress lines with no delimiter characters, when
              used with the -f option. Unless specified,  lines
              with   no  delimiters  shall  be  passed  through
              untouched.


OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       file   A pathname of an input file. If no file  operands
              are  specified, or if a file operand is '-' , the
              standard input shall be used.


STDIN
       The standard input shall be used only if no  file  oper-
       ands  are  specified, or if a file operand is '-' .  See
       the INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES
       The input files shall be text files,  except  that  line
       lengths shall be unlimited.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  following  environment  variables  shall affect the
       execution of cut:

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion  variables  that are unset or null. (See the
              Base Definitions volume of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section  8.2,  Internationalization Variables for
              the precedence of internationalization  variables
              used  to  determine  the  values  of locale cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override  the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine the locale for  the  interpretation  of
              sequences  of  bytes  of  text data as characters
              (for example, single-byte as  opposed  to  multi-
              byte characters in arguments and input files).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine  the  location  of message catalogs for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The cut utility output shall be a concatenation  of  the
       selected  bytes,  characters, or fields (one of the fol-
       lowing):


              "%s\n", <concatenation of bytes>


              "%s\n", <concatenation of characters>


              "%s\n", <concatenation of fields and field delimiters>

STDERR
       The standard error shall be  used  only  for  diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     All input files were output successfully.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Earlier  versions  of the cut utility worked in an envi-
       ronment  where  bytes  and  characters  were  considered
       equivalent  (modulo  <backspace> and <tab> processing in
       some implementations).  In the extended world of  multi-
       byte  characters,  the new -b option has been added. The
       -n option (used with -b) allows it to be used to act  on
       bytes  rounded  to  character  boundaries. The algorithm
       specified for -n guarantees that:


              cut -b 1-500 -n file > file1
              cut -b 501- -n file > file2

       ends up  with  all  the  characters  in  file  appearing
       exactly  once  in  file1 or file2. (There is, however, a
       <newline> in both file1 and file2 for each <newline>  in
       file.)

EXAMPLES
       Examples of the option qualifier list:

       1,4,7  Select  the  first,  fourth,  and  seventh bytes,
              characters, or fields and field delimiters.

       1-3,8  Equivalent to 1,2,3,8.

       -5,10  Equivalent to 1,2,3,4,5,10.

       3-     Equivalent to third to last, inclusive.


       The low- high forms are not always equivalent when  used
       with  -b  and  -n  and  multi-byte  characters;  see the
       description of -n.

       The following command:


              cut -d : -f 1,6 /etc/passwd

       reads the System V password  file  (user  database)  and
       produces lines of the form:


              <user ID>:<home directory>

       Most  utilities  in  this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
       work on text files. The cut utility can be used to  turn
       files  with  arbitrary  line  lengths into a set of text
       files containing the same data. The paste utility can be
       used  to  create (or recreate) files with arbitrary line
       lengths. For example, if file contains long lines:


              cut -b 1-500 -n file > file1
              cut -b 501- -n file > file2

       creates file1 (a text file) with lines  no  longer  than
       500  bytes  (plus the <newline>) and file2 that contains
       the remainder of the data from file. (Note that file2 is
       not  a  text  file  if  there are lines in file that are
       longer than 500 + {LINE_MAX} bytes.) The  original  file
       can be recreated from file1 and file2 using the command:


              paste -d "\0" file1 file2 > file

RATIONALE
       Some   historical   implementations   do    not    count
       <backspace>s in determining character counts with the -c
       option. This may be useful for using cut for  processing
       nroff  output.   It was deliberately decided not to have
       the -c option treat either <backspace>s or <tab>s in any
       special fashion. The fold utility does treat these char-
       acters specially.

       Unlike other utilities, some historical  implementations
       of cut exit after not finding an input file, rather than
       continuing to process the remaining file operands.  This
       behavior    is    prohibited    by    this   volume   of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, where  only  the  exit  status  is
       affected by this problem.

       The  behavior of cut when provided with either mutually-
       exclusive options or options that do not work  logically
       together has been deliberately left unspecified in favor
       of global wording in Utility Description Defaults .

       The OPTIONS section was changed in response to IEEE PASC
       Interpretation  1003.2  #149. The change represents his-
       torical practice on  all  known  systems.  The  original
       standard was ambiguous on the nature of the output.

       The  list  option-arguments  are  historically  used  to
       select the portions of the line to be  written,  but  do
       not affect the order of the data. For example:


              echo abcdefghi | cut -c6,2,4-7,1

       yields "abdefg" .

       A proposal to enhance cut with the following option:

       -o     Preserve  the  selected  field  order.  When this
              option is specified,  each  byte,  character,  or
              field (or ranges of such) shall be written in the
              order specified by the list option-argument, even
              if  this  requires  multiple  outputs of the same
              bytes, characters, or fields.


       was rejected because this type of enhancement is outside
       the scope of the IEEE P1003.2b draft standard.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
