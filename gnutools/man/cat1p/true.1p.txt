APPLICATION USAGE
       This  utility  is  typically  used  in shell scripts, as
       shown in the  EXAMPLES  section.  The  special  built-in
       utility : is sometimes more efficient than true.

EXAMPLES
       This command is executed forever:


              while true
              do
                  command
              done

RATIONALE
       The  true  utility  has  been retained in this volume of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  even  though  the  shell  special
       built-in  : provides similar functionality, because true
       is widely used in historical scripts and is less cryptic
       to novice script readers.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
