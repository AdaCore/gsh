NAME
       split - split files into pieces

SYNOPSIS
       split [-l line_count][-a suffix_length][file[name]]

       split -b n[k|m][-a suffix_length][file[name]]


DESCRIPTION
       The split utility shall read an input file and write one
       or more output files. The default size  of  each  output
       file  shall  be 1000 lines. The size of the output files
       can be  modified  by  specification  of  the  -b  or  -l
       options. Each output file shall be created with a unique
       suffix.  The  suffix  shall  consist  of  exactly   suf-
       fix_length  lowercase letters from the POSIX locale. The
       letters of the suffix shall be used as if  they  were  a
       base-26  digit  system, with the first suffix to be cre-
       ated consisting of all 'a' characters, the second with a
       'b'  replacing the last 'a' , and so on, until a name of
       all 'z' characters is created. By default, the names  of
       the  output files shall be 'x' , followed by a two-char-
       acter suffix from the character set as described  above,
       starting  with  "aa" , "ab" , "ac" , and so on, and con-
       tinuing until the suffix "zz" , for  a  maximum  of  676
       files.

       If  the  number  of  files  required exceeds the maximum
       allowed by the suffix length  provided,  such  that  the
       last  allowable  file would be larger than the requested
       size, the split utility shall fail  after  creating  the
       last  file  with  a valid suffix; split shall not delete
       the files it created with valid suffixes.  If  the  file
       limit  is not exceeded, the last file created shall con-
       tain the remainder of the input file, and may be smaller
       than the requested size.

OPTIONS
       The  split utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
       volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section  12.2,  Utility
       Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -a  suffix_length

              Use suffix_length letters to form the suffix por-
              tion of the filenames of the split file. If -a is
              not specified, the default suffix length shall be
              two. If the sum of the name operand and the  suf-
              fix_length  option-argument  would create a file-
              name exceeding {NAME_MAX} bytes, an  error  shall
              result;  split  shall exit with a diagnostic mes-
              sage and no files shall be created.

       -b  n  Split a file into pieces n bytes in size.

       -b  nk Split a file into pieces n*1024 bytes in size.

       -b  nm Split a file into pieces n*1048576 bytes in size.

       -l  line_count
              Specify  the  number  of  lines in each resulting
              file  piece.  The  line_count  argument   is   an
              unsigned decimal integer. The default is 1000. If
              the input does not end with a <newline>, the par-
              tial  line  shall  be included in the last output
              file.


OPERANDS
       The following operands shall be supported:

       file   The pathname of the ordinary file to be split. If
              no input file is given or file is '-' , the stan-
              dard input shall be used.

       name   The prefix to be  used  for  each  of  the  files
              resulting  from  the  split operation. If no name
              argument is given, 'x' shall be used as the  pre-
              fix  of  the output files. The combined length of
              the basename of prefix and  suffix_length  cannot
              exceed {NAME_MAX} bytes. See the OPTIONS section.


STDIN
       See the INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES
       Any file can be used as input.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment  variables  shall  affect  the
       execution of split:

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion variables that are unset or null.  (See  the
              Base  Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section 8.2, Internationalization  Variables  for
              the  precedence of internationalization variables
              used to determine  the  values  of  locale  cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If  set to a non-empty string value, override the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of
              sequences of bytes of  text  data  as  characters
              (for  example,  single-byte  as opposed to multi-
              byte characters in arguments and input files).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine the  locale  that  should  be  used  to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine the location of  message  catalogs  for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       Not used.

STDERR
       The  standard  error  shall  be used only for diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       The output files contain portions of the original  input
       file; otherwise, unchanged.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     Successful completion.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

EXAMPLES
       In  the  following examples foo is a text file that con-
       tains 5000 lines.

       Create five files, xaa, xab, xac, xad, and xae:


              split foo

       Create five files, but the suffixed portion of the  cre-
       ated  files consists of three letters, xaaa, xaab, xaac,
       xaad, and xaae:


              split -a 3 foo

       Create three files with four-letter suffixes and a  sup-
       plied prefix, bar_aaaa, bar_aaab, and bar_aaac:


              split -a 4 -l 2000 foo bar_

       Create as many files as are necessary to contain at most
       20*1024 bytes, each with the default prefix of x  and  a
       five-letter suffix:


              split -a 5 -b 20k foo

RATIONALE
       The  -b  option  was  added  to  provide a mechanism for
       splitting files other than by lines. While most uses  of
       the  -b option are for transmitting files over networks,
       some believed it would have additional uses.

       The -a option was added to overcome  the  limitation  of
       being able to create only 676 files.

       Consideration  was given to deleting this utility, using
       the rationale that the functionality  provided  by  this
       utility  is available via the csplit utility (see csplit
       ). Upon reconsideration  of  the  purpose  of  the  User
       Portability  Extension,  it  was  decided to retain both
       this utility and the csplit utility  because  users  use
       both utilities and have historical expectations of their
       behavior. Furthermore, the splitting on byte  boundaries
       in  split  cannot  be  duplicated  with  the  historical
       csplit.

       The text " split shall not delete the files  it  created
       with  valid  suffixes"  would  normally  be assumed, but
       since the related utility,  csplit,  does  delete  files
       under  some  circumstances,  the  historical behavior of
       split is made explicit to avoid misinterpretation.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
