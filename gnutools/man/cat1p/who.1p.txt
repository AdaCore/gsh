DESCRIPTION
       The who utility shall list various pieces of information
       about accessible users. The domain of  accessibility  is
       implementation-defined.

       Based on the options given, who can also list the user's
       name, terminal line,  login  time,  elapsed  time  since
       activity occurred on the line, and the process ID of the
       command interpreter for each current system user.

OPTIONS
       The who utility shall conform to  the  Base  Definitions
       volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section 12.2, Utility
       Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported. The  metavari-
       ables,  such as <line>, refer to fields described in the
       STDOUT section.

       -a     Process the  implementation-defined  database  or
              named  file  with  the -b, -d, -l, -p, -r, -t, -T
              and -u options turned on.

       -b     Write the time and date of the last reboot.

       -d     Write a list of all processes that  have  expired
              and   not  been  respawned  by  the  init  system
              process. The <exit> field shall appear  for  dead
              processes  and  contain  the termination and exit
              values of the dead process. This can be useful in
              determining why a process terminated.

       -H     Write column headings above the regular output.

       -l     (The  letter ell.) List only those lines on which
              the system is waiting for someone to  login.  The
              <name>  field shall be LOGIN in such cases. Other
              fields shall be the  same  as  for  user  entries
              except that the <state> field does not exist.

       -m     Output  only information about the current termi-
              nal.

       -p     List any other process that is  currently  active
              and has been previously spawned by init.

       -q     (Quick.)  List  only  the names and the number of
              users currently logged on. When  this  option  is
              used, all other options shall be ignored.

       -r     Write  the current run-level of the init process.

       -s     List only the <name>, <line>, and <time>  fields.
              This is the default case.

       -t     Indicate the last change to the system clock.

       -T     Show  the state of each terminal, as described in
              the STDOUT section.

       -u     Write "idle time"  for  each  displayed  user  in
              addition  to any other information. The idle time
              is the time since any activity  occurred  on  the
              user's  terminal.  The method of determining this
              is unspecified.    This option  shall  list  only
              those  users  who  are  currently  logged in. The
              <name> is the user's login name.  The  <line>  is
              the  name  of  the line as found in the directory
              /dev. The <time> is the time that the user logged
              in.  The  <activity>  is  the number of hours and
              minutes since activity last occurred on that par-
              ticular  line.  A dot indicates that the terminal
              has seen activity  in  the  last  minute  and  is
              therefore  "current".  If  more  than twenty-four
              hours have elapsed or the line has not been  used
              since boot time, the entry shall be marked <old>.
              This field is useful  when  trying  to  determine
              whether  a  person  is working at the terminal or
              not. The <pid> is the process ID  of  the  user's
              login process.


OPERANDS
       The following operands shall be supported:

       am i, am I
              In the POSIX locale, limit the output to describ-
              ing the  invoking  user,  equivalent  to  the  -m
              option.  The am and i or I must be separate argu-
              ments.

       file   Specify a pathname of a file  to  substitute  for
              the  implementation-defined database of logged-on
              users that who uses by default.


STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment  variables  shall  affect  the
       execution of who:

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion variables that are unset or null.  (See  the
              Base  Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section 8.2, Internationalization  Variables  for
              the  precedence of internationalization variables
              used to determine  the  values  of  locale  cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If  set to a non-empty string value, override the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of
              sequences of bytes of  text  data  as  characters
              (for  example,  single-byte  as opposed to multi-
              byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine the  locale  that  should  be  used  to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages written to standard error.

       LC_TIME
              Determine the locale used for the format and con-
              tents of the date and time strings.

       NLSPATH
              Determine  the  location  of message catalogs for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .

       TZ     Determine the timezone used when writing date and
              time  information.   If  TZ  is unset or null, an
              unspecified default timezone shall be used.


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The who utility shall write its default  format  to  the
       standard  output  in  an  implementation-defined format,
       subject only to the requirement of containing the infor-
       mation described above.

       XSI-conformant  systems shall write the default informa-
       tion to the standard output  in  the  following  general
       format:


              <name>[<state>]<line><time>[<activity>][<pid>][<comment>][<exit>] <img
               src="../images/opt-end.gif" border="0">

       The following format shall be used for the -T option:


              "%s %c %s %s\n" <name>, <terminal state>, <terminal name>,
                  <time of login>

       where  <terminal state>  is one of the following charac-
       ters:

       +      The terminal allows write access to other  users.

       -      The  terminal denies write access to other users.

       ?      The terminal write-access state cannot be  deter-
              mined.


       In the POSIX locale, the <time of login> shall be equiv-
       alent in format to the output of:


              date +"%b %e %H:%M"

       If the -u option is used with -T, the idle time shall be
       added  to  the end of the previous format in an unspeci-
       fied format.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be  used  only  for  diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     Successful completion.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  name  init  used for the system process is the most
       commonly used on historical systems, but it may vary.

       The "domain of accessibility" referred  to  is  a  broad
       concept  that  permits  interpretation  either on a very
       secure basis or even to allow a network-wide implementa-
       tion like the historical rwho.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       Due  to  differences between historical implementations,
       the base options provided were  a  compromise  to  allow
       users  to work with those functions. The standard devel-
       opers also considered removing all the options, but felt
       that these options offered users valuable functionality.
       Additional  options  to  match  historical  systems  are
       available on XSI-conformant systems.

       It  is recognized that the who command may be of limited
       usefulness, especially in a multi-level secure  environ-
       ment.  The standard developers considered, however, that
       having some standard method of determining the "accessi-
       bility" of other users would aid user portability.

       No  format  was specified for the default who output for
       systems not supporting the  XSI  Extension.  In  such  a
       user-oriented command, designed only for human use, this
       was not considered to be a deficiency.

       The format of the terminal name is unspecified, but  the
       descriptions  of  ps,  talk, and write require that they
       use the same format.

       It is acceptable for an  implementation  to  produce  no
       output for an invocation of who mil.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
