NAME
       join - relational database operator

SYNOPSIS
       join  [-a  file_number  |  -v file_number][-e string][-o
       list][-t char]
               [-1 field][-2 field] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       The join utility shall perform an equality join  on  the
       files file1 and file2. The joined files shall be written
       to the standard output.

       The join field is a field in  each  file  on  which  the
       files  are  compared.   The join utility shall write one
       line in the output for each pair of lines in  file1  and
       file2  that  have identical join fields. The output line
       by default shall consist of the  join  field,  then  the
       remaining  fields  from file1, then the remaining fields
       from file2. This format can be changed by using  the  -o
       option  (see  below).  The  -a option can be used to add
       unmatched lines to the output.  The  -v  option  can  be
       used to output only unmatched lines.

       The  files  file1 and file2 shall be ordered in the col-
       lating sequence of sort -b on the fields on  which  they
       shall be joined, by default the first in each line.  All
       selected output shall be written in the  same  collating
       sequence.

       The default input field separators shall be <blank>s. In
       this case, multiple separators shall count as one  field
       separator,  and leading separators shall be ignored. The
       default output field separator shall be a <space>.

       The  field  separator  and  collating  sequence  can  be
       changed by using the -t option (see below).

       If  the  same key appears more than once in either file,
       all combinations of the set of remaining fields in file1
       and  the  set of remaining fields in file2 are output in
       the order of the lines encountered.

       If the input files are not in the appropriate  collating
       sequence, the results are unspecified.

OPTIONS
       The  join  utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
       volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section  12.2,  Utility
       Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -a  file_number

              Produce  a  line for each unpairable line in file
              file_number, where file_number  is  1  or  2,  in
              addition  to  the default output. If both -a1 and
              -a2 are specified, all unpairable lines shall  be
              output.

       -e  string
              Replace  empty output fields in the list selected
              by -o with the string string.

       -o  list
              Construct the output line to comprise the  fields
              specified  in  list,  each element of which shall
              have one of the following two forms:

       file_number.field, where file_number is  a  file  number
       and field is a decimal integer field number

       0 (zero), representing the join field

       The  elements of list shall be either comma-separated or
       <blank>-separated, as specified in Guideline  8  of  the
       Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
       12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines. The fields specified by
       list  shall  be  written  for all selected output lines.
       Fields selected by list that do not appear in the  input
       shall  be  treated  as empty output fields.  (See the -e
       option.) Only specifically  requested  fields  shall  be
       written.  The  application  shall  ensure that list is a
       single command line argument.

       -t  char
              Use character char as a separator, for both input
              and  output.   Every appearance of char in a line
              shall be significant. When this option is  speci-
              fied, the collating sequence shall be the same as
              sort without the -b option.

       -v  file_number

              Instead of the default  output,  produce  a  line
              only  for  each  unpairable  line in file_number,
              where file_number is 1 or 2. If both -v1 and  -v2
              are specified, all unpairable lines shall be out-
              put.

       -1  field
              Join on the fieldth field of file 1.  Fields  are
              decimal integers starting with 1.

       -2  field
              Join  on  the fieldth field of file 2. Fields are
              decimal integers starting with 1.


OPERANDS
       The following operands shall be supported:

       file1, file2
              A pathname of a file to be joined. If  either  of
              the file1 or file2 operands is '-' , the standard
              input shall be used in its place.


STDIN
       The standard input shall be used only if  the  file1  or
       file2 operand is '-' . See the INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES
       The input files shall be text files.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  following  environment  variables  shall affect the
       execution of join:

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion  variables  that are unset or null. (See the
              Base Definitions volume of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section  8.2,  Internationalization Variables for
              the precedence of internationalization  variables
              used  to  determine  the  values  of locale cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override  the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_COLLATE

              Determine the locale of  the  collating  sequence
              join  expects  to  have  been used when the input
              files were sorted.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine the locale for  the  interpretation  of
              sequences  of  bytes  of  text data as characters
              (for example, single-byte as  opposed  to  multi-
              byte characters in arguments and input files).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine  the  location  of message catalogs for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The join utility output  shall  be  a  concatenation  of
       selected  character  fields.  When  the -o option is not
       specified, the output shall be:


              "%s%s%s\n", <join field>, <other file1 fields>,
                  <other file2 fields>

       If the join field is not the first field in a file,  the
       <other file fields> for that file shall be:


              <fields preceding join field>, <fields following join field>

       When the -o option is specified, the output format shall
       be:


              "%s\n", <concatenation of fields>

       where the concatenation of fields is described by the -o
       option, above.

       For either format, each field (except the last) shall be
       written with its trailing separator  character.  If  the
       separator  is  the default ( <blank>s), a single <space>
       shall be written after each field (except the last).

STDERR
       The standard error shall be  used  only  for  diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     All input files were output successfully.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       Pathnames  consisting  of  numeric digits or of the form
       string.string should not be specified directly following
       the -o list.

EXAMPLES
       The -o 0 field essentially selects the union of the join
       fields.  For example, given file phone:


              !Name           Phone Number
              Don             +1 123-456-7890
              Hal             +1 234-567-8901
              Yasushi         +2 345-678-9012

       and file fax:


              !Name           Fax Number
              Don             +1 123-456-7899
              Keith           +1 456-789-0122
              Yasushi         +2 345-678-9011

       (where the large expanses of white space  are  meant  to
       each represent a single <tab>), the command:


              join -t "<tab>" -a 1 -a 2 -e '(unknown)' -o 0,1.2,2.2 phone fax

       would produce:


              !Name           Phone Number            Fax Number
              Don             +1 123-456-7890         +1 123-456-7899
              Hal             +1 234-567-8901         (unknown)
              Keith           (unknown)               +1 456-789-0122
              Yasushi         +2 345-678-9012         +2 345-678-9011

       Multiple instances of the same key will produce combina-
       torial results.  The following:


              fa:
                  a x
                  a y
                  a z
              fb:
                  a p

       will produce:


              a x p
              a y p
              a z p

       And the following:


              fa:
                  a b c
                  a d e
              fb:
                  a w x
                  a y z
                  a o p

       will produce:


              a b c w x
              a b c y z
              a b c o p
              a d e w x
              a d e y z
              a d e o p

RATIONALE
       The -e option  is  only  effective  when  used  with  -o
       because, unless specific fields are identified using -o,
       join is not aware of what fields  might  be  empty.  The
       exception  to this is the join field, but identifying an
       empty join field with the -e string  is  not  historical
       practice  and  some  scripts  might  break  if this were
       changed.

       The 0 field in the -o list was adopted  from  the  Tenth
       Edition  version of join to satisfy international objec-
       tions that the join in the base documents does not  sup-
       port  the "full join" or "outer join" described in rela-
       tional database literature. Although it has been  possi-
       ble  to  include a join field in the output (by default,
       or by field number using -o), the join field  could  not
       be  included for an unpaired line selected by -a. The -o
       0 field  essentially  selects  the  union  of  the  join
       fields.

       This  sort  of outer join was not possible with the join
       commands in the base documents. The -o 0 field was  cho-
       sen  because  it  is  an  upwards-compatible  change for
       applications. An alternative was  considered:  have  the
       join  field  represent  the  union  of the fields in the
       files (where they are identical for matched  lines,  and
       one  or both are null for unmatched lines). This was not
       adopted because it would break some historical  applica-
       tions.

       The  ability  to  specify  file2  as - is not historical
       practice; it was added for completeness.

       The -v option is not historical practice, but  was  con-
       sidered  necessary  because  it permitted the writing of
       only those lines that do not match on the join field, as
       opposed  to  the -a option, which prints both lines that
       do and do not match. This additional facility is  paral-
       lel with the -v option of grep.

       Some  historical  implementations  have been encountered
       where a blank line in one of the input files was consid-
       ered  to be the end of the file; the description in this
       volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not cite this as  an
       allowable case.
