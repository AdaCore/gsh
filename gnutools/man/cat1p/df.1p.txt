NAME
       df - report free disk space

SYNOPSIS
       df  [-k][-P|-t][file...]<img src="../images/opt-end.gif"
       alt="[Option End]" border="0">

DESCRIPTION
       The df utility shall write the amount of available space
       <img  src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]"
       border="0">  and file slots  for file systems  on  which
       the invoking user has appropriate read access. File sys-
       tems shall be specified by the file operands; when  none
       are specified, information shall be written for all file
       systems. The format of the default  output  from  df  is
       unspecified,  but  all  space  figures  are  reported in
       512-byte units, unless the -k option is specified.  This
       output  shall  contain  at  least the file system names,
       amount of available space on each of these file systems,
        and  the  number  of free file slots, or inodes, avail-
       able; when -t is specified, the output shall contain the
       total allocated space as well.

OPTIONS
       The  df  utility  shall  conform to the Base Definitions
       volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section  12.2,  Utility
       Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -k     Use  1024-byte  units,  instead  of  the  default
              512-byte units, when writing space figures.

       -P     Produce output in the  format  described  in  the
              STDOUT section.

       -t     Include total allocated-space figures in the out-
              put.


OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       file   A pathname of a file within the hierarchy of  the
              desired  file  system.   If  a  file other than a
              FIFO, a regular file, a directory,  or a  special
              file  representing the device containing the file
              system (for example, /dev/dsk/0s1)  is specified,
              the results are unspecified.  Otherwise, df shall
              write the amount of free space in the file system
              containing the specified file operand.


STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  following  environment  variables  shall affect the
       execution of df:

       LANG   Provide    a    default     value     for     the
              internationalization  variables that are unset or
              null.  (See  the  Base  Definitions   volume   of
              IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, International-
              ization Variables for the precedence of  interna-
              tionalization  variables  used  to  determine the
              values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override  the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine the locale for  the  interpretation  of
              sequences  of  bytes  of  text data as characters
              (for example, single-byte as  opposed  to  multi-
              byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages  written  to standard error and informative
              messages written to standard output.

       NLSPATH
              Determine the location of  message  catalogs  for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       When  both the -k and -P options are specified, the fol-
       lowing header  line  shall  be  written  (in  the  POSIX
       locale):


              "Filesystem 1024-blocks Used Available Capacity Mounted on\n"

       When  the  -P option is specified without the -k option,
       the following header line shall be written (in the POSIX
       locale):


              "Filesystem 512-blocks Used Available Capacity Mounted on\n"

       The  implementation may adjust the spacing of the header
       line and the individual data lines so that the  informa-
       tion is presented in orderly columns.

       The  remaining  output with -P shall consist of one line
       of information for each  specified  file  system.  These
       lines shall be formatted as follows:


              "%s %d %d %d %d%% %s\n", <file system name>, <total space>,
                  <space used>, <space free>, <percentage used>,
                  <file system root>

       In  the  following  list,  all  quantities  expressed in
       512-byte units (1024-byte when -k is specified) shall be
       rounded up to the next higher unit. The fields are:

       <file system name>

              The  name  of  the file system, in an implementa-
              tion-defined format.

       <total space>
              The total size of the  file  system  in  512-byte
              units. The exact meaning of this figure is imple-
              mentation-defined,     but     should     include
              <space used>,   <space free>,   plus   any  space
              reserved by the system not normally available  to
              a user.

       <space used>
              The  total  amount of space allocated to existing
              files in the file system, in 512-byte units.

       <space free>
              The total amount of space  available  within  the
              file  system  for  the  creation  of new files by
              unprivileged users, in 512-byte units. When  this
              figure  is  less  than or equal to zero, it shall
              not be possible to create any new  files  on  the
              file system without first deleting others, unless
              the process has appropriate privileges.  The fig-
              ure written may be less than zero.

       <percentage used>

              The  percentage  of  the normally available space
              that is currently allocated to all files  on  the
              file  system.  This shall be calculated using the
              fraction:


              <space used>/( <space used>+ <space free>)

       expressed  as  a  percentage.  This  percentage  may  be
       greater  than 100 if <space free> is less than zero. The
       percentage value shall be expressed as a positive  inte-
       ger, with any fractional result causing it to be rounded
       to the next highest integer.

       <file system root>

              The directory below which the file system hierar-
              chy appears.


       The output format is unspecified when -t is used.

STDERR
       The  standard  error  shall  be used only for diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     Successful completion.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       On most systems, the "name of the  file  system,  in  an
       implementation-defined  format"  is  the special file on
       which the file system is mounted.

       On large file systems,  the  calculation  specified  for
       percentage used can create huge rounding errors.

EXAMPLES
       The  following example writes portable information about
       the /usr file system:


              df -P /usr

       Assuming that /usr/src is part of the /usr file  system,
       the  following  produces the same output as the previous
       example:


              df -P /usr/src

RATIONALE
       The behavior of df with the -P  option  is  the  default
       action  of  the 4.2 BSD df utility. The uppercase -P was
       selected to avoid collision with a known industry exten-
       sion using -p.

       Historical df implementations vary considerably in their
       default output. It was therefore necessary  to  describe
       the  default output in a loose manner to accommodate all
       known historical implementations and to add  a  portable
       option  (  -P) to provide information in a portable for-
       mat.

       The use of 512-byte units  is  historical  practice  and
       maintains  compatibility  with ls and other utilities in
       this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. This does not  man-
       date  that  the  file system itself be based on 512-byte
       blocks. The -k option was added as a compromise measure.
       It  was agreed by the standard developers that 512 bytes
       was the best default unit because of its  complete  his-
       torical  consistency  on  System  V  (versus  the  mixed
       512/1024-byte usage on  BSD  systems),  and  that  a  -k
       option  to  switch to 1024-byte units was a good compro-
       mise. Users who prefer the more logical 1024-byte  quan-
       tity  can easily alias df to df -k without breaking many
       historical scripts relying on the 512-byte units.

       It was suggested that df and the various related  utili-
       ties be modified to access a BLOCKSIZE environment vari-
       able to achieve consistency and user  acceptance.  Since
       this  is  not  historical  practice on any system, it is
       left as a possible area for system extensions  and  will
       be  re-evaluated  in  a  future  version if it is widely
       implemented.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
