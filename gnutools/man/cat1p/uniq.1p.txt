NAME
       uniq - report or filter out repeated lines in a file

SYNOPSIS
       uniq  [-c|-d|-u][-f  fields][-s  char][input_file  [out-
       put_file]]

DESCRIPTION
       The uniq utility shall  read  an  input  file  comparing
       adjacent lines, and write one copy of each input line on
       the  output.   The  second  and  succeeding  copies   of
       repeated adjacent input lines shall not be written.

       Repeated  lines  in  the  input shall not be detected if
       they are not adjacent.

OPTIONS
       The uniq utility shall conform to the  Base  Definitions
       volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section 12.2, Utility
       Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -c     Precede each output line with a count of the num-
              ber of times the line occurred in the input.

       -d     Suppress  the  writing  of  lines  that  are  not
              repeated in the input.

       -f  fields
              Ignore the first fields fields on each input line
              when  doing  comparisons, where fields is a posi-
              tive decimal integer.  A  field  is  the  maximal
              string matched by the basic regular expression:


              [[:blank:]]*[^[:blank:]]*

       If the fields option-argument specifies more fields than
       appear on an input line, a null string shall be used for
       comparison.

       -s  chars
              Ignore the first chars characters when doing com-
              parisons, where chars shall be a positive decimal
              integer.  If specified in conjunction with the -f
              option, the  first  chars  characters  after  the
              first  fields  fields  shall  be  ignored. If the
              chars option-argument specifies  more  characters
              than remain on an input line, a null string shall
              be used for comparison.

       -u     Suppress the writing of lines that  are  repeated
              in the input.


OPERANDS
       The following operands shall be supported:

       input_file
              A  pathname  of the input file. If the input_file
              operand is not specified, or if the input_file is
              '-' , the standard input shall be used.

       output_file
              A pathname of the output file. If the output_file
              operand is not  specified,  the  standard  output
              shall be used. The results are unspecified if the
              file named by output_file is the  file  named  by
              input_file.


STDIN
       The  standard  input shall be used only if no input_file
       operand is specified or if input_file is '-' .  See  the
       INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES
       The input file shall be a text file.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  following  environment  variables  shall affect the
       execution of uniq:

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion  variables  that are unset or null. (See the
              Base Definitions volume of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section  8.2,  Internationalization Variables for
              the precedence of internationalization  variables
              used  to  determine  the  values  of locale cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override  the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_COLLATE

              Determine the locale for ordering rules.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine the locale for  the  interpretation  of
              sequences  of  bytes  of  text data as characters
              (for example, single-byte as  opposed  to  multi-
              byte characters in arguments and input files) and
              which characters constitute a <blank> in the cur-
              rent locale.

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine  the  location  of message catalogs for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The standard output shall be used only if no output_file
       operand is specified. See the OUTPUT FILES section.

STDERR
       The  standard  error  shall  be used only for diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       If the -c option is specified, the output file shall  be
       empty or each line shall be of the form:


              "%d %s", <number of duplicates>, <line>

       otherwise,  the  output file shall be empty or each line
       shall be of the form:


              "%s", <line>

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     The utility executed successfully.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The sort utility can be used to cause repeated lines  to
       be adjacent in the input file.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  input  file  data (but flushed left) was
       used for a test series on uniq:


              #01 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1
              #02 bar0 foo1 bar1 foo1
              #03 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1
              #04
              #05 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1
              #06 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1
              #07 bar0 foo1 bar1 foo0

       What follows is a series of test invocations of the uniq
       utility  that  use a mixture of uniq options against the
       input file data. These tests verify the meaning of adja-
       cent.   The  uniq  utility  views  the  input  data as a
       sequence of strings delimited by '\n' . Accordingly, for
       the  fieldsth  member  of  the sequence, uniq interprets
       unique or repeated adjacent lines strictly  relative  to
       the fields+1th member.

       This  first example tests the line counting option, com-
       paring each line of the input file  data  starting  from
       the second field:


              uniq -c -f 1 uniq_0I.t
                  1 #01 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1
                  1 #02 bar0 foo1 bar1 foo0
                  1 #03 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1
                  1 #04
                  2 #05 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1
                  1 #07 bar0 foo1 bar1 foo0

       The  number  '2'  ,  prefixing the fifth line of output,
       signifies that the  uniq  utility  detected  a  pair  of
       repeated  lines.  Given the input data, this can only be
       true when uniq is run using the -f 1 option (which shall
       cause  uniq  to  ignore  the  first  field on each input
       line).

       The second example tests the option to  suppress  unique
       lines, comparing each line of the input file data start-
       ing from the second field:


              uniq -d -f 1 uniq_0I.t
              #05 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1

       This test suppresses repeated lines, comparing each line
       of the input file data starting from the second field:


              uniq -u -f 1 uniq_0I.t
              #01 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1
              #02 bar0 foo1 bar1 foo1
              #03 foo0 bar0 foo1 bar1
              #04
              #07 bar0 foo1 bar1 foo0

       This suppresses unique lines, comparing each line of the
       input file data starting from the third character:


              uniq -d -s 2 uniq_0I.t

       In the last example, the uniq  utility  found  no  input
       matching the above criteria.

RATIONALE
       Some historical implementations have limited lines to be
       1080 bytes in length, which does not  meet  the  implied
       {LINE_MAX} limit.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
