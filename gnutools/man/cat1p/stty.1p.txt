NAME
       stty - set the options for a terminal

SYNOPSIS
       stty [ -a| -g]

       stty operands


DESCRIPTION
       The  stty  utility  shall  set or report on terminal I/O
       characteristics for the  device  that  is  its  standard
       input.  Without  options or operands specified, it shall
       report the settings of certain characteristics,  usually
       those  that differ from implementation-defined defaults.
       Otherwise, it shall modify the terminal state  according
       to  the  specified  operands. Detailed information about
       the modes listed in the  first  five  groups  below  are
       described    in   the   Base   Definitions   volume   of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Chapter  11,   General   Terminal
       Interface.  Operands in the Combination Modes group (see
       Combination Modes ) are implemented  using  operands  in
       the  previous  groups. Some combinations of operands are
       mutually-exclusive on some terminal types;  the  results
       of using such combinations are unspecified.

       Typical implementations of this utility require a commu-
       nications line configured to use the  termios  interface
       defined    in    the   System   Interfaces   volume   of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. On systems  where  none  of  these
       lines  are available, and on lines not currently config-
       ured to support the termios interface, some of the oper-
       ands need not affect terminal characteristics.

OPTIONS
       The  stty  utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
       volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section  12.2,  Utility
       Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -a     Write to standard output all the current settings
              for the terminal.

       -g     Write to standard output all the current settings
              in  an unspecified form that can be used as argu-
              ments to another invocation of the  stty  utility
              on  the same system. The form used shall not con-
              tain any characters that would require quoting to
              avoid  word  expansion  by  the  shell;  see Word
              Expansions .

   Special Control Character Assignments
       <control>-character string

              Set   <control>-character  to  string.  If  <con-
              trol>-character is one of the character sequences
              in  the  first column of the following table, the
              corresponding   Base   Definitions   volume    of

              nal Interface control character from  the  second
              column  shall  be recognized. This has the effect
              of  setting  the  corresponding  element  of  the
              termios c_cc array (see the Base Definitions vol-
              ume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 13, Headers,

       If  string  is a single character, the control character
       shall be set to that character. If string  is  the  two-
       character sequence "^-" or the string undef, the control
       character shall be set to _POSIX_VDISABLE , if it is  in
       effect  for  the  device;  if  _POSIX_VDISABLE is not in
       effect for the device, it shall be treated as an  error.
       In  the  POSIX  locale,  if  string  is  a two-character
       sequence beginning with circumflex ( '^' ), and the sec-
       ond  character is one of those listed in the "^c" column
       of the following table, the control character  shall  be

              values.


STDIN
       Although no input is read from standard input,  standard
       input  shall  be  used  to  get the current terminal I/O
       characteristics and to set new terminal I/O characteris-
       tics.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  following  environment  variables  shall affect the
       execution of stty:

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion  variables  that are unset or null. (See the
              Base Definitions volume of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section  8.2,  Internationalization Variables for
              the precedence of internationalization  variables
              used  to  determine  the  values  of locale cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override  the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_CTYPE
              This  variable  determines  the  locale  for  the
              interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data
              as  characters  (for  example,   single-byte   as
              opposed  to  multi-byte  characters in arguments)
              and which characters are in the class print.

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine the  locale  that  should  be  used  to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine the location of  message  catalogs  for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       If  operands are specified, no output shall be produced.

       If the -g option is specified, stty shall write to stan-
       dard  output  the current settings in a form that can be
       used as arguments to another instance  of  stty  on  the
       same system.

       If the -a option is specified, all of the information as
       described in the OPERANDS section shall  be  written  to
       standard output. Unless otherwise specified, this infor-
       mation shall be written as <space>-separated  tokens  in
       an  unspecified  format,  on  one or more lines, with an
       unspecified  number  of  tokens  per  line.   Additional
       information may be written.

       If  no options or operands are specified, an unspecified
       subset of the information  written  for  the  -a  option
       shall be written.

       If  speed  information is written as part of the default
       output, or if the -a option is specified and if the ter-
       minal  input  speed  and  output speed are the same, the
       speed information shall be written as follows:


              "speed %d baud;", <speed>

       Otherwise, speeds shall be written as:


              "ispeed %d baud; ospeed %d baud;", <ispeed>, <ospeed>

       In locales other than the POSIX locale,  the  word  baud
       may  be  changed  to something more appropriate in those
       locales.

       If control characters are written as part of the default
       output,  or if the -a option is specified, control char-
       acters shall be written as:


              "%s = %s;", <control-character name>, <value>

       where <value> is either the character,  or  some  visual
       representation  of the character if it is non-printable,
       or the string undef if the character is disabled.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be  used  only  for  diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     The  terminal  options  were read or set success-
              fully.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The -g flag is designed to  facilitate  the  saving  and
       restoring  of  terminal  state from the shell level. For
       example, a program may:


              saveterm="$(stty -g)"       # save terminal state
              stty (new settings)         # set new state
              ...                         # ...
              stty $saveterm              # restore terminal state

       Since the format is unspecified, the saved value is  not
       portable across systems.

       Since  the  -a  format  is so loosely specified, scripts
       that save and restore terminal settings should  use  the
       -g option.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       The  original  stty  description was taken directly from
       System V and reflected  the  System  V  terminal  driver
       termio.   It has been modified to correspond to the ter-
       minal driver termios.

       Output modes are specified only for XSI-conformant  sys-
       tems.  All  implementations are expected to provide stty
       operands corresponding to all of the output  modes  they
       support.

       The  stty  utility  is primarily used to tailor the user
       interface of the terminal, such as  selecting  the  pre-
       ferred ERASE and KILL characters. As an application pro-
       gramming utility, stty can be used within shell  scripts
       to  alter  the terminal settings for the duration of the
       script.

       The termios section states that individual disabling  of
       control   characters  is  possible  through  the  option
       _POSIX_VDISABLE. If enabled, two  conventions  currently
       exist  for specifying this: System V uses "^-" , and BSD
       uses undef. Both are accepted by stty in this volume  of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.  The other BSD convention of using
       the letter 'u' was rejected because  it  conflicts  with
       the actual letter 'u' , which is an acceptable value for
       a control character.

       Early proposals did not specify the mapping of  "^c"  to
       control  characters  because the control characters were
       not specified in the POSIX locale character set descrip-
       tion  file  requirements.   The control character set is
       now  specified  in  the  Base  Definitions   volume   of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 3, Definitions so the his-
       torical mapping is specified.  Note  that  although  the
       mapping corresponds to control-character key assignments
       on many terminals that use the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
       (or  ASCII)  character  encodings, the mapping specified
       here is to the control characters,  not  their  keyboard
       encodings.

       Since  termios  supports  separate  speeds for input and
       output, two new options were added to specify each  dis-
       tinctly.

       Some  historical  implementations  use standard input to
       get and set terminal characteristics; others  use  stan-
       dard  output.  Since  input  from a login TTY is usually
       restricted to the owner while output to a  TTY  is  fre-
       quently  open  to  anyone, using standard input provides
       fewer chances of accidentally (or maliciously)  altering
       the  terminal  settings  of  other users. Using standard
       input also allows stty -a and stty -g output to be redi-
       rected for later use. Therefore, usage of standard input
       is required by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.
