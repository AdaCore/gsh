NAME
       nl - line numbering filter

SYNOPSIS
       nl [-p][-b type][-d delim][-f type][-h type][-i incr][-l
       num][-n format]
               [-s sep][-v startnum][-w width][file]

DESCRIPTION
       The nl utility shall read lines from the named  file  or
       the  standard input if no file is named and shall repro-
       duce the lines to standard output. Lines shall  be  num-
       bered  on the left. Additional functionality may be pro-
       vided in accordance with the command options in  effect.

       The nl utility views the text it reads in terms of logi-
       cal pages.  Line numbering shall be reset at  the  start
       of  each  logical  page.  A  logical  page consists of a
       header, a body, and a footer section. Empty sections are
       valid.  Different  line  numbering  options are indepen-
       dently available for header, body, and footer (for exam-
       ple,  no numbering of header and footer lines while num-
       bering blank lines only in the body).

       The starts of logical page sections shall be signaled by
       input  lines containing nothing but the following delim-
       iter characters:
             Line       Start of
             \:\:\:     Header
             \:\:       Body
             \:         Footer

       Unless otherwise specified, nl  shall  assume  the  text
       being read is in a single logical page body.

OPTIONS
       The  nl  utility  shall  conform to the Base Definitions
       volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section  12.2,  Utility
       Syntax Guidelines.  Only one file can be named.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -b  type
              Specify  which  logical  page body lines shall be
              numbered. Recognized types and their meaning are:

       a      Number all lines.

       t      Number only non-empty lines.

       n      No line numbering.

       pstring
              Number  only lines that contain the basic regular
              expression specified in string.


       The default type for logical page body shall be t  (text
       lines numbered).

       -d  delim
              Specify  the  delimiter  characters that indicate
              the start of a logical page section. These can be
              changed  from  the default characters "\:" to two
              user-specified characters. If only one  character
              is entered, the second character shall remain the
              default character ':' .

       -f  type
              Specify the same as b type except for footer. The
              default  for  logical  page footer shall be n (no
              lines numbered).

       -h  type
              Specify the same as b type except for header. The
              default  type  for logical page header shall be n
              (no lines numbered).

       -i  incr
              Specify the increment value used to number  logi-
              cal page lines. The default shall be 1.

       -l  num
              Specify  the  number of blank lines to be consid-
              ered as one. For example, -l 2  results  in  only
              the second adjacent blank line being numbered (if
              the appropriate -h a, -b a,  or  -f a  option  is
              set). The default shall be 1.

       -n  format
              Specify  the  line  numbering  format. Recognized
              values are: ln,  left  justified,  leading  zeros
              suppressed;  rn,  right  justified, leading zeros
              suppressed; rz, right  justified,  leading  zeros
              kept.  The default format shall be rn (right jus-
              tified).

       -p     Specify that numbering should not be restarted at
              logical page delimiters.

       -s  sep
              Specify  the  characters  used  in separating the
              line number and the corresponding text line.  The
              default sep shall be a <tab>.

       -v  startnum
              Specify  the initial value used to number logical
              page lines. The default shall be 1.

       -w  width
              Specify the number of characters to be  used  for
              the line number. The default width shall be 6.


OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       file   A pathname of a text file to be line-numbered.


STDIN
       The  standard  input  is  a text file that is used if no
       file operand is given.

INPUT FILES
       The input file named by the file operand is a text file.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  following  environment  variables  shall affect the
       execution of nl:

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion  variables  that are unset or null. (See the
              Base Definitions volume of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section  8.2,  Internationalization Variables for
              the precedence of internationalization  variables
              used  to  determine  the  values  of locale cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override  the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_COLLATE

              Determine the locale for the behavior of  ranges,
              equivalence  classes, and multi-character collat-
              ing elements within regular expressions.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine the locale for  the  interpretation  of
              sequences  of  bytes  of  text data as characters
              (for example, single-byte as  opposed  to  multi-
              byte  characters  in  arguments and input files),
              the behavior of character classes within  regular
              expressions,  and  for  deciding which characters
              are in character class graph (for the -b t, -f t,
              and -h t options).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine  the  location  of message catalogs for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The standard output shall be a text file in the  follow-
       ing format:


              "%s%s%s", <line number>, <separator>, <input line>

       where <line number> is one of the following numeric for-
       mats:

       %6d    When the rn format is used (the default; see -n).

       %06d   When the rz format is used.

       %-6d   When the ln format is used.

       <empty>
              When line numbers are suppressed for a portion of
              the page; the <separator> is also suppressed.


       In the preceding list,  the  number  6  is  the  default
       width; the -w option can change this value.

STDERR
       The  standard  error  shall  be used only for diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     Successful completion.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       In using the -d delim option, care should  be  taken  to
       escape  characters that have special meaning to the com-
       mand interpreter.

EXAMPLES
       The command:


              nl -v 10 -i 10 -d \!+ file1

       numbers file1 starting at line number 10 with an  incre-
       ment  of  10.  The logical page delimiter is "!+" . Note
       that the '!' has to be escaped when using csh as a  com-
       mand  interpreter  because  of  its history substitution
       syntax. For ksh and sh the escape is not necessary,  but
       does not do any harm.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
