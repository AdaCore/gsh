NAME
       unexpand - convert spaces to tabs

SYNOPSIS
       unexpand      [     -a|     -t     tablist][file...]<img
       src="../images/opt-end.gif"  alt="[Option   End]"   bor-
       der="0">

DESCRIPTION
       The  unexpand utility shall copy files or standard input
       to standard output, converting <blank>s at the beginning
       of  each line into the maximum number of <tab>s followed
       by the minimum number of <space>s  needed  to  fill  the
       same  column  positions  originally filled by the trans-
       lated <blank>s. By default, tabstops  shall  be  set  at
       every eighth column position.  Each <backspace> shall be
       copied to the output, and shall cause the  column  posi-
       tion  count  for tab calculations to be decremented; the
       count shall never be decremented to a  value  less  than
       one.

OPTIONS
       The  unexpand  utility shall conform to the Base Defini-
       tions  volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section  12.2,
       Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -a     In addition to translating <blank>s at the begin-
              ning of each line, translate all sequences of two
              or more <blank>s immediately preceding a tab stop
              to the maximum number of <tab>s followed  by  the
              minimum  number  of  <space>s  needed to fill the
              same column positions originally  filled  by  the
              translated <blank>s.

       -t  tablist
              Specify  the  tab  stops.  The  application shall
              ensure that the tablist option-argument is a sin-
              gle argument consisting of a single positive dec-
              imal integer or multiple positive  decimal  inte-
              gers, separated by <blank>s or commas, in ascend-
              ing order.  If a single  number  is  given,  tabs
              shall  be  set  tablist  column  positions  apart
              instead of the default 8. If multiple numbers are
              given,  the  tabs  shall be set at those specific
              column positions.

       The application shall ensure that each tab-stop position
       N  is  an  integer value greater than zero, and the list
       shall be in strictly ascending order. This is  taken  to
       mean  that,  from the start of a line of output, tabbing
       to position N shall cause the next character  output  to
       be  in  the  ( N+1)th column position on that line. When
       the -t option is not specified, the default shall be the
       equivalent  of  specifying -t 8 (except for the interac-
       tion with -a, described below).

       No <space>-to- <tab> conversions shall occur for charac-
       ters  at positions beyond the last of those specified in
       a multiple tab-stop list.

       When -t is specified, the presence or absence of the  -a
       option shall be ignored; conversion shall not be limited
       to the processing of leading <blank>s.


OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       file   A pathname of a text file to be used as input.


STDIN
       See the INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES
       The input files shall be text files.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment  variables  shall  affect  the
       execution of unexpand:

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion variables that are unset or null.  (See  the
              Base  Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section 8.2, Internationalization  Variables  for
              the  precedence of internationalization variables
              used to determine  the  values  of  locale  cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If  set to a non-empty string value, override the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of
              sequences of bytes of  text  data  as  characters
              (for  example,  single-byte  as opposed to multi-
              byte characters in arguments  and  input  files),
              the  processing  of  <tab>s and <space>s, and for
              the determination of the width  in  column  posi-
              tions  each  character  would occupy on an output
              device.

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine the  locale  that  should  be  used  to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine the location of  message  catalogs  for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The  standard  output  shall  be equivalent to the input
       files with the specified <space>-to- <tab>  conversions.

STDERR
       The  standard  error  shall  be used only for diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     Successful completion.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       One non-intuitive aspect of unexpand is its  restriction
       to  leading  spaces when neither -a nor -t is specified.
       Users who always want to convert all spaces  in  a  file
       can  easily alias unexpand to use the -a or -t 8 option.

EXAMPLES
       None.

RATIONALE
       On several occasions, consideration was given to  adding
       a -t option to the unexpand utility to complement the -t
       in expand (see expand ). The historical intent of  unex-
       pand  was to translate multiple <blank>s into tab stops,
       where tab stops were a multiple of  eight  column  posi-
       tions on most UNIX systems. An early proposal omitted -t
       because it seemed outside the scope of the  User  Porta-
       bility  Utilities option; it was not described in any of
       the base  documents.   However,  hard-coding  tab  stops
       every  eight  columns  was not suitable for the interna-
       tional community and  broke  historical  precedents  for
       some  vendors  in  the  FORTRAN  community,  so  -t  was
       restored in conjunction with the list of valid extension
       categories  considered by the standard developers. Thus,
       unexpand is now the logical converse of expand.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
