NAME
       comm - select or reject lines common to two files

SYNOPSIS
       comm [-123] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       The  comm  utility  shall  read  file1  and file2, which
       should be ordered in the current collating sequence, and
       produce  three  text  columns  as  output: lines only in
       file1, lines only in file2, and lines in both files.

       If the lines in both files are not ordered according  to
       the  collating  sequence  of  the  current  locale,  the
       results are unspecified.

OPTIONS
       The comm utility shall conform to the  Base  Definitions
       volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  Section 12.2, Utility
       Syntax Guidelines.

       The following options shall be supported:

       -1     Suppress the output column  of  lines  unique  to
              file1.

       -2     Suppress  the  output  column  of lines unique to
              file2.

       -3     Suppress the output column of lines duplicated in
              file1 and file2.


OPERANDS
       The following operands shall be supported:

       file1  A  pathname  of the first file to be compared. If
              file1 is '-' , the standard input shall be  used.

       file2  A  pathname of the second file to be compared. If
              file2 is '-' , the standard input shall be  used.


       If  both  file1  and file2 refer to standard input or to
       the same FIFO special, block special, or character  spe-
       cial file, the results are undefined.

STDIN
       The  standard  input  shall  be  used only if one of the
       file1 or file2 operands refers to  standard  input.  See
       the INPUT FILES section.

INPUT FILES
       The input files shall be text files.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The  following  environment  variables  shall affect the
       execution of comm:

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion  variables  that are unset or null. (See the
              Base Definitions volume of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section  8.2,  Internationalization Variables for
              the precedence of internationalization  variables
              used  to  determine  the  values  of locale cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override  the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_COLLATE

              Determine the locale for the  collating  sequence
              comm  expects  to  have  been used when the input
              files were sorted.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine the locale for  the  interpretation  of
              sequences  of  bytes  of  text data as characters
              (for example, single-byte as  opposed  to  multi-
              byte characters in arguments and input files).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine  the  location  of message catalogs for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The comm utility shall produce output depending  on  the
       options  selected. If the -1, -2, and -3 options are all
       selected, comm shall write nothing to standard output.

       If the -1 option is not selected, lines  contained  only
       in file1 shall be written using the format:


              "%s\n", <line in file1>

       If  the  -2 option is not selected, lines contained only
       in file2 are written using the format:


              "%s%s\n", <lead>, <line in file2>

       where the string <lead> is as follows:

       <tab>  The -1 option is not selected.

       null string
              The -1 option is selected.


       If the -3 option is not  selected,  lines  contained  in
       both files shall be written using the format:


              "%s%s\n", <lead>, <line in both>

       where the string <lead> is as follows:

       <tab><tab>
              Neither the -1 nor the -2 option is selected.

       <tab>  Exactly one of the -1 and -2 options is selected.

       null string
              Both the -1 and -2 options are selected.


       If the input files were ordered according to the collat-
       ing  sequence  of  the current locale, the lines written
       shall be in  the  collating  sequence  of  the  original
       lines.

STDERR
       The  standard  error  shall  be used only for diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     All input files were successfully output as spec-
              ified.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       If  the input files are not properly presorted, the out-
       put of comm might not be useful.

EXAMPLES
       If a file named xcu contains a sorted list of the utili-
       ties  in  this  volume  of  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, a file
       named xpg3 contains a sorted list of the utilities spec-
       ified  in  the  X/Open Portability Guide, Issue 3, and a
       file named svid89 contains a sorted list of  the  utili-
       ties in the System V Interface Definition Third Edition:


              comm -23 xcu xpg3 | comm -23 - svid89

       would print a  list  of  utilities  in  this  volume  of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001  not  specified  by  either  of the
       other documents:


              comm -12 xcu xpg3 | comm -12 - svid89

       would print a list of utilities specified by  all  three
       documents, and:


              comm -12 xpg3 svid89 | comm -23 - xcu

       would  print  a list of utilities specified by both XPG3
       and the SVID,  but  not  specified  in  this  volume  of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.

RATIONALE
       None.
