NAME
       dirname - return the directory portion of a pathname

SYNOPSIS
       dirname string

DESCRIPTION
       The  string  operand  shall be treated as a pathname, as
       defined   in   the   Base    Definitions    volume    of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,   Section   3.266,  Pathname.  The
       string string shall be converted  to  the  name  of  the
       directory  containing  the filename corresponding to the
       last pathname component in  string,  performing  actions
       equivalent to the following steps in order:

       If string is //, skip steps 2 to 5.

       If  string consists entirely of slash characters, string
       shall be set to a single slash character. In this  case,
       skip steps 3 to 8.

       If  there  are  any trailing slash characters in string,
       they shall be removed.

       If there are no slash characters  remaining  in  string,
       string  shall  be  set  to a single period character. In
       this case, skip steps 5 to 8.

       If  there  are  any  trailing  non-slash  characters  in
       string, they shall be removed.

       If  the  remaining  string  is //, it is implementation-
       defined whether steps 7 and 8 are skipped or  processed.

       If  there  are  any trailing slash characters in string,
       they shall be removed.

       If the remaining string is empty, string shall be set to
       a single slash character.

       The  resulting  string shall be written to standard out-
       put.

OPTIONS
       None.

OPERANDS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       string A string.


STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment  variables  shall  affect  the
       execution of dirname:

       LANG   Provide a default value for the internationaliza-
              tion variables that are unset or null.  (See  the
              Base  Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              Section 8.2, Internationalization  Variables  for
              the  precedence of internationalization variables
              used to determine  the  values  of  locale  cate-
              gories.)

       LC_ALL If  set to a non-empty string value, override the
              values  of  all  the  other  internationalization
              variables.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of
              sequences of bytes of  text  data  as  characters
              (for  example,  single-byte  as opposed to multi-
              byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine the  locale  that  should  be  used  to
              affect the format and contents of diagnostic mes-
              sages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine the location of  message  catalogs  for
              the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       The  dirname  utility shall write a line to the standard
       output in the following format:


              "%s\n", <resulting string>

STDERR
       The standard error shall be  used  only  for  diagnostic
       messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     Successful completion.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The  definition  of  pathname  specifies implementation-
       defined behavior for pathnames starting with  two  slash
       characters.  Therefore, applications shall not arbitrar-
       ily add slashes to the beginning of  a  pathname  unless
       they  can ensure that there are more or less than two or
       are prepared to  deal  with  the  implementation-defined
       consequences.

EXAMPLES
       Command              Results
       dirname /            /
       dirname //           / or //
       dirname /a/b/        /a
       dirname //a//b//     //a
       dirname              Unspecified
       dirname a            . ($? = 0)
       dirname ""           . ($? = 0)
       dirname /a           /
       dirname /a/b         /a
       dirname a/b          a

RATIONALE
       The  dirname  utility  originated  in System III. It has
       evolved through the System V releases to a version  that
       matches  the  requirements specified in this description
       in System V Release 3.  4.3 BSD and earlier versions did
       not include dirname.

       The  behaviors of basename and dirname in this volume of
       IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 have been coordinated so that  when
       string is a valid pathname:


              $(basename "string")

       would be a valid filename for the file in the directory:


              $(dirname "string")

       This would not work for the versions of these  utilities
       in early proposals due to the way processing of trailing
       slashes was specified. Consideration was given to  leav-
       ing   processing  unspecified  if  there  were  trailing
       slashes, but this cannot be done; the  Base  Definitions
       volume  of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.266, Pathname
       allows trailing slashes. The basename and dirname utili-
       ties  have  to specify consistent handling for all valid
       pathnames.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
