Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in flex-2.5.4a-1-GnuWin32.diffs in flex-2.5.4a-1-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
