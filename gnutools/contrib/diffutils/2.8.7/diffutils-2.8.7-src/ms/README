This directory contains files required to build GNU Diffutils on
MS_DOS and MS-Windows using the DJGPP tools.

To build Diffutils, you will need the following packages:

    . the basic DJGPP development kit: GCC, Binutils, and djdevNNN.zip
    . a DJGPP port of Bash (bsh204b.zip)
    . GNU Fileutils (fil40b.zip)
    . GNU Textutils (txt20b.zip)
    . GNU Sh-utils (shl112b.zip)
    . GNU Grep (grep24b.zip)
    . GNU Awk (gwk306b.zip)
    . GNU Sed (sed302b.zip)
    . GNU Make (mak3791b.zip)

The package names in parentheses indicate the oldest version which
should work; newer versions are okay.  All those packages can be found
on the usual DJGPP sites, in the v2gnu directory.  Please see
<http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/getting.html> for a list of DJGPP sites.

The source distribution of Diffutils you find on DJGPP sites comes
preconfigured for the latest officially released version of the DJGPP
library, and without NLS support.  If that is what you have installed,
and if you don't need NLS support in Diffutils, you don't need to run
the configure script; proceed directly to the "make" step below.

If you are building the official GNU distribution, or your library is
not the latest official release, or if you modified your headers or
installed optional libraries, or if you want to have NLS support in
Diffutils, you will have to reconfigure the package.  To this end,
after unpacking the sources, chdir to the top-level directory created
by unpacking, and type this command:

   ms\config [nls]

The "nls" option, if given, will configure the package for NLS
support.

This will run for a while and create the Makefile's and the config.h
header file.

Next type "make"; this will build the programs.

To install the package, type "make install".

That's it!
