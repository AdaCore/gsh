The development source code is available via CVS from Savannah: see
<http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=grep>.  The main project page is at
<http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/grep/>.

The source code in the CVS uses autotools to generate some files. Before
following the instructions in the INSTALL file for compiling grep, you
need to run the autogen.sh script. If you don't have the autotools
installed on your system, you can download a CVS release file (generated
with `make dist') from <http://www.dal-acm.ca/~taa/grep/>.

Test releases are available at <http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grep/>.

Please submit bug reports to <bug-grep@gnu.org>.

If you are interested in the development of GNU grep, you may want to
subscribe to the development mailing list.  To subscribe, send an email
message to <bug-grep-request@gnu.org> with "subscribe" (without the
quotation marks) in the subject header field (or in the body) of the
email, or visit <http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-grep>.

To follow development more closely, there is also the grep-commit mailing
list to which log entries (one per commit) and diff output (one per
modified file) from CVS are automatically sent.  To subscribe, send an
email message to <grep-commit-request@gnu.org> with "subscribe" (without
the quotation marks) in the subject header field (or in the body) of
the email, or visit <http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/grep-commit>.

A web page containing information for GNU grep developers is at 
<http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/devel.html>.
