2005-11-18  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * tests/foad1.sh: Use ": ${VERBOSE=}" so that the caller can
          set it without modifying the script; the usual caller (Makefile)
          still leaves it untouched (usually unset, so it's off by default).
          Modify "-m1 -A99 '^...$'" tests that failed so that their
          expectation now corresponds to the output currently produced
          by grep.  Those tests used to expect that two selected (or
          selectable) lines be output, even with -m1.  Nothing was
          modified with other similar tests that output _context_ lines
          after one selected line has been output with -m1; they used to
          and still succeed.  Although tests/yesno.sh now provides a more
          comprehensive framework for testing -m/-C feature interaction,
          it doesn't exercise mixing them with anchors so the whole
          relevant tests/foad1.sh test group is kept, notably to check
          that grep doesn't crash when it is run.

2005-11-17  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        On 2005-06-21, many changes were made that affected --color,
        --only-matching, and --invert-match.  Some of them introduced a
        misunderstanding between the concepts of matched/non-matched and
        selected/rejected lines.  Furthermore, a few bugs with -v sneaked
        in stemming from this.  This set of changes aims to rectify most
        of this situation.  Some GREP_COLORS capabilities are also added
        as a result of the clarification.  (Further issues with -v/-o/-C
        feature interaction still remain to be sorted out.)

        * src/grep.c: Rename/add global variables, macros, and capabilities:
            SEP_CHAR_MATCH    -->  SEP_CHAR_SELECTED
            SEP_CHAR_CONTEXT  -->  SEP_CHAR_REJECTED
            SEP_STR_CHUNK     -->  SEP_STR_GROUP
            grep_color        -->  selected_match_color + context_match_color
            mlines_color      -->  selected_line_color
            context_color     -->  context_line_color
            "ml"              -->  "sl"
            "mt"              -->  "mt" = "ms" + "mc"
                              -->  "rv" (reverse "sl"/"cx" when -v)
        * src/grep.c (color_cap_mt_fct, color_cap_rv_fct): New functions.
        * src/grep.c (print_line_tail): Renamed color argument to line_color.
        * src/grep.c (print_line_middle, prline): Revert part of the logic to
          a pre-2005-06-21 one so that lines with matches have their matched
          parts properly handled again ("m?" colors or --only-matching),
          whether or not -v is specified.  Whole line colors ("sl", "cx")
          follow a selected / rejected(context) logic, as opposed to a
          matched / non-matched one (unless "rv").  Matched text colors ("ms",
          "mc") always follow a selected / rejected(context) logic,
          regardless of "rv", because only matched lines use them anyway.
          pr_line_middle() now takes additional line_color and match_color
          arguments computed by prline() prior to calling that function.
          The old logic was a buggy hybrid matched / rejected(context) one.
        * src/grep.c (prpending, prtext, grepfile): Renamed macro invocations.
        * src/grep.c (parse_grep_colors): Update top comment.
        * src/grep.c (main): GREP_COLOR (singular) now sets both
          selected_match_color and context_match_color.

2005-11-16  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * src/search.c (Pcompile): Clarify message for the -P option
          not being supported so that users don't assume it's a run-time
          problem, but know that it's a compile-time configuration choice.
          Based on an idea by:  Benno Schulenberg <benno@nietvergeten.nl>.

2005-11-13  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * tests/yesno.sh: New file.  Test feature interaction
          of -C, -v, -o, and -m.  This reveals bugs, including some I
          introduced on 2005-06-21, but also others.
        * tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add yesno.sh.
        * tests/Makefile.am (CLEANFILES): Add cspatfile and csinput, as
          created by fmbtest.sh.  Add yesno.txt, as created by yesno.sh.

2005-11-11  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Add languages that were missing
          from this variable (bg, ca, da, nb, tr), but that GNU grep supports
          with a po/xx.po file.  Reported by Tony Abou-Assaleh <taa@acm.org>.

        * src/search.c (Pcompile): Abort in error if -P and multiple patterns
          are specified, with an error message explaining the situation.
          Fixing this won't be simple; the '\n' characters separating the
          patterns cannot just be replaced by '|' to create an alternation as
          back-references are assumed to be local to each individual pattern.

        * src/grep.c (parse_grep_colors, main): Replace all uses of
          fprintf(stderr, _("%s: foo\n"), program_name, ...) with
          error(0, 0, _("foo"), ...) for uniformization and simplification
          of warning messages that will be up for localization.  (My bad.)

2005-11-10  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        The introduction of the --only-matching and --color GNU extensions
        to grep added the requirement that each execute() implementation
        not only be able to identify matching lines as a whole, but also
        individual "exact" matches within a line known to be matching,
        from leftmost to rightmost match, when the output from matching
        lines is actually produced.  The interface and implementations
        of execute() were not up to it.  This set of changes aims to
        rectify that situation.  Previously failing tests relative to
        left anchors (^ and \<) and -w should now pass.  This fixes
        <http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=11579>,
        <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?func=detailitem&item_id=1834>,
        <http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=8243>,
        and possibly part of other, bigger, pending patches.  The problem
        was also compounded by the POSIX requirement to support a pattern
        list instead of just an individual pattern (for -G and -E as well).

        * tests/foad1.sh: Test for increasing/decreasing-length word
          matches, given pattern order, and leftmost/longest match.
        * tests/fmbtest.sh: Modify test #6 according to new expectations.
          Better document what tests #6 and #7 are actually for.  Eliminate
          test #5 in favor of bringing tests #6 and #7 within the F G E loop.
        * src/grep.h (EXECUTE_ARGS): Change last argument from "int exact"
          to "char const *start_ptr".  Testing for "start_ptr" being non-NULL
          retains the same semantics as testing for "exact" being non-zero.
        * src/grep.c (print_line_middle): Call execute() with whole
          buffer to work on, but using current position as start_ptr.
        * src/grep.c (prpending, grepbuf): Call execute() with NULL
          as start_ptr.
        * src/search.c (EGexecute, Fexecute, Pexecute): When start_ptr is
          non-NULL, return first match from it as an offset relative to buf.
        * src/search.c (EGexecute): Consider all patterns if many and,
          for an exact match, return the best one (leftmost, then longest).
          Don't explore worst solutions, of course (branch and bound).

2005-11-10  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * src/grep.c (main): Fix a subtle memory allocation bug introduced
          with the mb_icase_keys() function, which can call xrealloc() or
          free() on keys, by making sure keys is always dynamically allocated.

2005-11-09  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * doc/grep.1, doc/grep.texi: Advise users to test for
          "exit_status > 1" instead of "exit_status == 2" in order to
          detect errors, for portability with other POSIX-compliant
          implementations.

2005-11-09  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        The following set of changes aims to make "egrep" and "fgrep"
        minimal executable programs for legacy applications, instead of
        shell scripts.  This "fgrep" is much smaller than "grep".
        This set of changes appears more daunting than it really is.

        * src/egrep.c, src/fgrep.c, src/esearch.c, src/fsearch.c: New files
          that #define either EGREP_PROGRAM or FGREP_PROGRAM and #include
          the corresponding generic (i.e., non e or f specific) *.c file.
        * src/grepmat.c: Remove whole file.
        * src/Makefile.am: Remove no-dependencies from AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS.
          Add definitions to make "egrep" and "fgrep" specific standalone
          executable programs that only use the source files they need.
          Remove rules for "egrep" and "fgrep" shell scripts.
        * src/grep.h: #define GREP_PROGRAM if both EGREP_PROGRAM and
          FGREP_PROGRAM are #undef.  Only declare matchers[] in this case
          along with the compile_fp_t and execute_fp_t function pointers
          typedefs, otherwise declare prototypes for straight compile()
          and execute() functions for the specialized "egrep" and "fgrep"
          programs.  Remove the extern declaration for matcher.
          Define COMPILE_RET, COMPILE_ARGS, EXECUTE_RET, EXECUTE_ARGS,
          COMPILE_FCT, and EXECUTE_FCT helper preprocessor macros.
        * src/grep.c (short_options, long_options, usage, main): Only
          support -G, -E, -F, -P, and -X for GREP_PROGRAM, but not for
          EGREP_PROGRAM or FGREP_PROGRAM.  Customize usage messages.
        * src/grep.c (set_limits): New function with unchanged code,
          called from main(), because it shouldn't be in install_matcher()
          since it was already matcher-independent.
        * src/grep.c (matcher): Add as static, only for GREP_PROGRAM.
        * src/grep.c (setmatcher, install_matcher): Only for GREP_PROGRAM.
        * src/grep.c (main): Remove any tweaking and dependence on argv[0].
        * src/grep.c (print_line_middle, prpending, grepbuf, main): Call
          compile() and execute() directly, not through a function
          pointer dereferencing notation, so that it works with both
          straight functions (in EGREP_PROGRAM and FGREP_PROGRAM) and
          function pointers (in GREP_PROGRAM).
        * src/search.c (<regex.h>, "dfa.h", dfa, pattern0, patterns,
          pcount, dfaerror, kwset_exact_matches, kwsmusts): Only
          include/declare/define if not FGREP_PROGRAM.
        * src/search.c: Remove function prototypes for all functions
          that are not used before their definition, since this is just
          a hassle now with their varying names and conditional definition.
        * src/search.c (GEAcompile): Rename from Ecompile().  Add new
          syntax_bits argument/variable.  Use as compile() for EGREP_PROGRAM.
          Put in the needed RE_ICASE fix, albeit commented-out for now.
          Make sure to free() modified word/line pattern after use, if any.
        * src/search.c (Gcompile): Merge with GEAcompile() then remove.
        * src/search.c (Gcompile, Acompile, Ecompile): New small functions
          that call GEAcompile(), now that matcher is not an extern variable.
        * src/search.c (GEAcompile, Gcompile, Acompile, Ecompile,
          Fcompile, Pcompile, EGexecute, Fexecute, Pexecute, matchers):
          Only define when needed according to *GREP_PROGRAM, and rename
          to just compile() and execute() when appropriate.
        * grep/bootstrap/Makefile.try: Similar changes.

        * README.DOS, TODO, grep.spec, doc/grep.1, doc/grep.texi,
          src/grep.h, po/da.po, po/nb.po, po/no.po, po/sv.po:
          Replace all capitalized "Grep" by a lowercase "grep", except
          in citations.  Reported by Benno Schulenberg <benno@nietvergeten.nl>
          from the <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=190551>
          entry in the Debian bug tracker.
        * doc/grep.1, doc/grep.texi: Explain that the "egrep" and "fgrep"
          commands are deprecated and provided for historical applications.
          Replace some "egrep" uses by "grep -E" to promote the newer usage.
          Typeset "zgrep" as a command.  Fix some spacing and punctuation bugs.

2005-11-08  Julian Foad  <julianfoad@btopenworld.com>

        * doc/grep.texi: Rewrite a poorly written usage example about
          back-references, and tweak another.  New text by Benno Schulenberg.

2005-11-04  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * src/grep.c (mb_icase_keys): New function to properly lowercase
          keys if match_icase.  The problem was that some multi-octet
          characters can get longer or shorter upon this conversion, so that
          it cannot just naively be done in place on the same memory buffer.
        * src/grep.c (main): Call mb_icase_keys (and remove in-line code).

        * tests/foad1.sh:  Duplicate three "-o -b" tests for the "-F"
          mode because it relies on a different code path that deserves
          the same kind of testing.

2005-09-27  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * doc/grep.1: Fix a typo.

2005-08-24  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * src/grep.c (print_line_middle): In case of an empty match,
          make minimal progress and continue instead of aborting process
          of the remainder of the line, in case there's still an upcoming
          non-empty match.
        * tests/foad1.sh: Add two tests for this.
        * doc/grep.texi, doc/grep.1: Document this behavior, since
          --only-matching and --color are GNU extensions which are
          otherwise unspecified by POSIX or other standards.

2005-07-26  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * tests/pcre.sh: New file.  Add test 1.
        * tests/Makefile.am: Add pcre.sh to TESTS.

2005-07-07  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * src/grep.c: Remove all xm capability code.

2005-07-05  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * doc/grep.texi: Add missing green color in GREP_COLORS description.
        * doc/grep.1: Fix typo and reorganize GREP_COLORS documentation.

        * src/kwset.c (DEPTH_SIZE): New macro to anticipate
          architectures/compilers where CHAR_BIT is not 8 (we assume it
          won't be less than 4, which would be non-standard and unlikely).
          Checked to hold for CHAR_BIT up to 1023 (and maybe more)!
        * src/kwset.c (kwsincr): Use DEPTH_SIZE in two array declarations.

        * src/kwset.c (kwsincr): When a second obstack_alloc() call fails,
          free what the first one successfully allocated by popping it
          off the top of the obstack, before returning in error, just
          to keep things clean.
        * src/kwset.c (kwsprep): Verify return value of obstack_alloc()
          and return a memory exhausted error if so.  This function had
          a prototype to return such errors, but never did.

2005-07-04  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * src/kwset.c: Readability changes.
          Replace uses of 0 for pointer values by NULL.
          Generalize use of existing U() macro to whole file.

        * src/kwset.c (kwsprep): Use memset() and memcpy() when appropriate.

        * src/kwset.c (kwsprep): Move three variable declarations to
          the single {}-block where they are used.

        * src/kwset.c (kwsprep): Optimize search for mind2 value by
          starting from the end of the target[] array.

2005-06-22  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * grep/autogen.sh, grep/src/Makefile.am, grep/tests/backref.sh,
          grep/tests/bre.sh, grep/tests/empty.sh, grep/tests/ere.sh,
          grep/tests/file.sh, grep/tests/fmbtest.sh, grep/tests/foad1.sh,
          grep/tests/khadafy.sh, grep/tests/options.sh,
          grep/tests/spencer1.sh, grep/tests/spencer2.sh,
          grep/tests/status.sh, grep/tests/warning.sh: As per autoconf's
          "Portable Shell Programming" guidelines, replace all instances
          of "#!/bin/sh" by "#! /bin/sh" (notice the space).

2005-06-21  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * src/grep.c (nlscan): Make this function more robust by removing
          the undocumented assumption that its "lim" argument points
          right after a line boundary.  This will be used later to fix
          --byte-offset's broken behavior.  Patch #3769.

        * src/grep.c (main): Add a test to check if -o/--only-matching
          and context lines are both specified and if so, set both context
          specifications (before and after) to zero then print an explicit
          warning to stderr explaining what was done and why (as opposed
          to drastically aborting the process in error).  Patch #3768.
          Other code needs this zero setting to work correctly without
          having to repeatedly test for this conflictual condition.

        * tests/foad1.sh: Add tests combining -o, -n/-b/-H, and -i,
          since there are separate code paths for -i.  Add tests combining
          -o, -n/-b/-H, and -3, since any context line specification
          should be ignored when combined with -o.
        * src/grep.c (print_line_head): New function, culled off the
          top content of prline().  Adds a guard against "lastnl" having
          already reached "lim", which can happen when if the function
          is called more than once per line.
        * src/grep.c (prline): Now calls print_line_head(), not only at
          the beginning to replace the moved code when -o is not
          specified, but also for each match when -o is specified (two
          code paths with this).  Patch #3770, more or less.  This makes
          all tests combining -o and -n/-b/-H pass, which they didn't
          before.  Fixes bug #12727.

        * src/grep.c (SEP_CHAR_MATCH, SEP_CHAR_CONTEXT, SEP_STR_CHUNK):
          New macros for ':', '-', and "--".  Used throughout the file.
          Will be used even more in upcoming updates, so good to have now.

        * src/grep.c: The new GREP_COLORS (plural) framework, only
          partially used at this point to make for a simpler initial
          patch in CVS.  A subset of patch #3644 on Savannah.
        * src/grep.c (color_cap_ne_fct, color_cap_xm_fct, print_filename,
          print_sep, parse_grep_colors): New functions.
        * src/grep.c (prtext, grepfile, main): Existing functions modified
          to use the new framework.
        * doc/grep.texi, doc/grep.1: Document GREP_COLORS.

        * src/grep.c: The new -T/--initial-tab framework, only
          partially used at this point to make for a simpler initial
          patch in CVS.  A subset of patch #3644 on Savannah.
          The option name/calling convention is the same as for GNU diff.
        * doc/grep.texi, doc/grep.1: Document -T/--initial-tab.

        * src/grep.c (print_offset): Renamed print_offset_sep() to better
          represent its new functionality; new calling convention.
        * src/grep.c (print_offset, print_line_head): Use and implement
          missing parts of the GREP_COLORS and -T/--initial-tab frameworks.

        * src/grep.c (print_line_middle, print_line_tail): New functions,
          unused for now, intended to allow a simplifying rewrite of
          prline().  Adding them first will make for cleaner CVS patches.

        * src/grep.c (prline): Simplifying rewrite using
          print_line_middle() and print_line_tail().  No longer attempts
          to find matches to colorize in context lines, thus avoiding
          costly calls to (*execute)(), since we know by then that they
          can't contain any by definition.  There are no longer four
          different code paths whether -o and -i are each specified
          or not; they have been unified into one, which should help
          avoid bugs similar to previous ones due to not updating all
          code paths in a synchronized fashion.  The -i code has been
          explicitly marked since it doesn't belong there and should
          be removed as soon as other -i code elsewhere is fixed.
          The remaining GREP_COLORS functionality is implemented.
          Savannah patch #3771 and patch #3644, heavily reworked.

        * src/grep.c (color_cap_ne_fct, color_cap_xm_fct,
          print_line_middle, print_line_tail): Make these four functions
          static.

2005-06-20  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * src/grep.c: Extensively document the SGR/EL-to-Right issue.

        * src/grep.c: Explain the context and logic for choosing default
          --color screen attributes (SGR parameters).

2005-06-15  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * tests/foad1.sh: Since this script is run by /bin/sh, it
          must work under posix mode.  That means not using assignment
          statements right before a function call (LC_ALL=... grep_test,
          in this case), because it won't do the expected thing.

2005-06-14  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        Fix bug #11022 (Line wrapping causes GREP_COLOR background
        color to "smear") by outputting a "clear to end of line"
        control sequence after each SGR (Select Graphic Rendition)
        control sequence (START and END).  This also avoid similar
        problems with HT (tab) characters.

        * src/grep.c (SGR_START, SGR_END, PR_SGR_FMT, PR_SGR_FMT_IF,
          PR_SGR_START, PR_SGR_END, PR_SGR_START_IF, PR_SGR_END_IF):
          New macros.
        * src/grep.c (prline): Use the new macros.
        * tests/fmbtest.sh, tests/foad1.sh: Adjust the regression tests
          to expect the new control sequences.

2005-05-06  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * TODO: Add a few more projects and derived versions to check out.

2005-05-05  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * README-alpha: Document grep-commit mailing list.
        * TODO: Add various stuff culled from the mailing list.

2005-05-02  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * 78 files: Update FSF's civic address, zip code,
          and citizen relocation code.

2005-04-29  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * tests/foad1.sh: Add -b and tricky UTF-8 tests.
          Display LC_ALL when its value is special.  Patch #3962.

        * ABOUT-NLS: Sync with CVS revision 1.9
          of 2005-04-13T11:21:55Z from GNU gettext
          on ":pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/gettext",
          file "gettext/gettext-runtime/ABOUT-NLS".

2005-04-29  Julian Foad  <julianfoad@btopenworld.com>

        * Makefile.am: Remove reference to long-gone files PATCHES.AC and
          PATCHES.AM.  Thanks to Tony Abou-Assaleh for this.  Patch #3961.

2005-04-29  Charles Levert  <charles_levert@gna.org>

        * src/grep.c: Fix typo in prline()'s --only-matching --ignore-case
          code path; this fixes bug #9768 and passes one more test
          in tests/foad1.sh.  This whole code path should be removed in
          the future, when other --ignore-case issues are dealt with.

2005-04-28  Julian Foad  <julianfoad@btopenworld.com>

        * tests/foad1.sh: Remove Bash-specific syntax.

        * src/dfa.c: Fix a DFA bug whereby a bracket "[" was matched by the
          pattern "[[:alpha:]]" in UTF-8 locales.  Patch #3800, by Tim Waugh.
        * tests/foad1.sh: Add a regression test for that.

2005-04-27  Julian Foad  <julianfoad@btopenworld.com>

        Fix a bug reported by Elliott Hughes in patch #1834 whereby "grep -Fw"
        would miss matches after a non-word occurrence of the pattern.  Fix by
        Gordon Lack; tests based on reproduction recipes by Gordon Lack.

        * src/search.c (Fexecute): Fix the "match_words" case.
        * tests/foad1.sh: Modify the test framework so that the "PATTERN"
          argument is optional.  Add a regression test and a test for
          a similar case that other proposed patches have got wrong.

        Add more tests, some initially failing.

        * tests/foad1.sh: Add tests for "--color", most initially failing.
        * tests/fmbtest.sh: New file of tests for "grep -i" with multi-byte
          chars, by Jakub Jelinek, from patch #3808: Red Hat's "tests" patch.
          Initially, test #4 fails (in all three modes).
        * tests/Makefile.am: Include the new tests file "fmbtest.sh".

2005-04-12  Julian Foad  <julianfoad@btopenworld.com>

        * tests/bre.tests: Enable a regression test for bug #9519.
        * src/grep.c: Fix a seg-fault in "-o -i": patch #1939.
        * tests/foad1.sh: New tests for "-o", initially all failing.
        * tests/Makefile.am: Include the new tests file "foad1.sh".
        * tests/spencer2.sh: Be consistent with "spencer1.sh" in the
          naming of associated files.
        * src/grep.c: Fix off-by-one error in prpending().
          Patch #3840 by Claudio Fontana.
        * tests/foad1.sh: Add tests by Pavol Gono for patch #3840.
          Some of them still fail, but no longer seg-fault due to that bug.

2005-04-11  Julian Foad  <julianfoad@btopenworld.com>

        * doc/grep.texi, doc/grep.1: Document USG grep -s too.
          Based on a patch by Paul Eggert; suggested by Keith Marshall.
        * src/dfa.c (lex): Fix bug #9519: "echo do^re | grep do^re" was
          failing to find a match.

2005-03-09  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * src/search.c (EGexecute, Fexecute): Use xmalloc, not malloc.
        (EGexecute): Handle the failure in one place, goto there.

2005-02-26  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * src/grep.c (get_nondigit_option): Don't give up too early.
        * src/search.c (Pexecute): Add a comment explaining that this
          situation should not happen.

2005-02-22  Claudio Fontana  <sick_soul@users.sourceforge.net>  (tiny change)

        * src/search.c (Pexecute): Consider eof case when delimiting
          matching line.  Fixes bug #4531.

2005-02-23  Julian Foad  <julianfoad@btopenworld.com>

        * po/ko.po: Fix email address.
        * README-alpha: Fix email addresses and clarify the notes.
        * tests/backref.sh: Fix trivial typos.

2005-02-08  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>  (tiny change)

        * src/kwset.h (kwsincr, kwsprep): Change return type to 'const char *'.
        * src/kwset.c (kwsincr, kwsprep): Likewise.

2005-02-08  Arnold D. Robbins  <arnold@skeeve.com>
            Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * src/mbsupport.h: Don't say the file is part of GAWK.
        Make wording in explanatory comment more generic.

2005-02-07  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * src/grep.c: Document that -X is undocumented.

2005-01-16  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>  (tiny change)
            Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * configure.in: Add tests for iswctype, mbrlen, wcrtomb, wcscoll;
          use AC_FUNC_MBRTOWC to check for mbrtowc and mbstate_t; move
          AC_MBSTATE_T below it.
        * src/grep.c: Include mbsupport.h to define MBS_SUPPORT uniformly.
        * src/mbsupport.h: Don't test for HAVE_WCTYPE_T.

2005-01-13  Arnold D. Robbins  <arnold@skeeve.com>

        * src/dfa.c (dfaparse): Use LC_COLLATE whenever it is defined;
          ENABLE_NLS has nothing to do with this.

2005-01-07  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * tests/status.sh: Added two tests--option `-s' should have no
          influence on the exit status.

2004-12-16  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        Cosmetic changes, mostly imported from gawk:

        * src/dfa.c (lexstart): Removed unused variable.
        (parse_bracket_exp_mb): Don't initialize different pointers in one
          assignment
        (lex): Don't initialize automatic arrays, it's invalid in pre-C89
          compilers.
        Various other typos.
        * src/dfa.h, src/grep.c, src/search.c: Typos.

2004-12-16  Isamu Hasegawa  <isamuh@jp.ibm.com>

        From http://oss.software.ibm.com/linux/patches/?patch_id=25

        * src/search.c: Patch for i18n correctness.

2004-12-01  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * src/grep.c (usage): Use ``FILE_PATTERN'' for --include and --exclude,
          change ``only print'' to ``print only''.
        * doc/grep.1: Likewise; state that wildcard matching is used.
          Move some options so that they are sorted alphabetically.
        * dfa.c, NEWS: Fix typos.

2004-11-28  Benno Schulenberg  <benno@nietvergeten.nl>  (tiny change)

        * src/grep.c (usage): Clean up several details in the usage string.
        * doc/grep.1: Fix descriptions of --include and --exclude.
        * doc/grep.texi: Likewise.

2004-11-23  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * src/Makefile.am: The egrep and fgrep script now use their own
        path to construct the full pathname of grep.

2004-11-23  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * src/Makefile.am: Merged the rules for creating the egrep and
        fgrep script.

2004-11-23  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * src/grep.c (usage): Make sure both copies of the ``usage''
          strings match.  Add ``(C)'' to the copyright notice.
        * src/dfa.c: Changed ``out of memory'' to ``memory exhausted'' to
          match messages elsewhere in the source.

2004-11-22  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * src/search.c: Use mbsupport.h .
        * src/dfa.c: Move the inclusion of mbsupport.h lower.

2004-11-22  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * src/grep.c (main): Use PACKAGE_STRING for --version.

2004-11-20  Benno Schulenberg  <benno@nietvergeten.nl>  (tiny change)

        * src/grep.c (reset): Move the stat check ...
        (grepfile): ... here, and also check for a fifo.

2004-11-20  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        This change is based on a suggestion by Elliott Hughes.

        * src/grep.c (usage): Use PACKAGE_BUGREPORT.
        * po/*.po: Hacked the current translation again.

2004-11-20  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * configure.in: Added a copyright notice (using gawk as a template).
        (AC_INIT, AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Changed to the ``new'' form so that
          the PACKAGE_* symbols get defined correctly in config.h.

2004-11-20  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

        * ./cvsignore: Amended several .cvsignore files and

2001-07-29  Alain Magloire

        David Clissold, wrote:
        a small bug in the GNU grep 2.4.2, which may have gone unnoticed
        because it only causes a failure if building on a system with large
        files enabled (e.g. an "off_t" is a "long long" rather than a "long").
        savedir() takes on off_t argument, but in grepdir() the parameter
        is cast to an (unsigned).  Well, if an off_t is larger than an int,
        the value gets truncated.  This would not normally have an effect on a
        little-endian platform (unless the file is >2GB), but on a big-endian
        system it will always fail.  The external effect is that
        "grep -r foo dir_name" fails with ENOMEM (from malloc() within
        savedir()).

        * grep/src/grep.c (grepdir): Remove the (unsigned) cast when calling
        savedir().
        Patch from David Clissold.

        Stop trying to support hosts that have nonstandard declarations for
        mbrtowc and/or mbstate_t.  It's not worth the portability hassle.

        * lib/quotearg.c (mbrtowc, mbsinit): Remove workaround macros
        for hosts that have mbrtowc but not mbstate_t, as we now

        Only the Regex patterns should be split in an array, patterns[].
        The dfa and KWset compiled patterns should remain global and the
        patterns compiled all at once.

        * src/search.c: include "error.h" and "xalloc.h" to get prototyping
        of x*alloc() and error().

        (kwsmusts): Likewised.
        (Gcompile): For the regex pattern, split them and each pattern

        (Ecompile): Likewised.
        (Fcompile): Reverse to the old behaviour of compiling the enire
        patterns in one shot.

        array of compile patterns[] to find a match.
        (error): Many error () were call with arguments in the wrong order.
        * tests/file.sh: Simple test to check for pattern in files.

2001-02-17  Alain Magloire

        From Guglielmo 'bond' Bondioni :
        The bug was that using a multi line file that contained REs (one per
        line), backreferences in the REs were considered global (to the file)
        and not local (to the line).
        That is, \1 in line n refers to the first \(.\) in the whole file,
        rather than in the line itself.

        From Tapani Tarvainen :
        # Re: grep -e '\(a\)\1' -e '\(b\)\1'
        That's not the way it should work: multiple -e arguments
        should be treated as independent patterns and back references
        should not refer to previous ones.

        From Paul Eggert :
        GNU grep currently does not issue
        diagnostics for the following two cases, both of which are erroneous:
        grep -e '[' -e ']'
        grep '[
        ]'
        POSIX requires a diagnostic in both cases because '[' is not a valid
        regular expression.

        To overcome those problems, grep no longer pass the concatenate
        patterns to GNU regex but rather compile each patterns separately
        and keep the result in an array.

        * src/search.c (patterns): New global variable; a structure array
        holding the compiled patterns.
        Declare function prototypes to minimize error.
        (dfa, kswset, regexbuf, regs): Removed, no longer static globals, but
        rather fields in patterns[] structure per motif.
        (Fcompile): Alloc an entry in patterns[] to hold the regex.
        (Ecompile): Alloc an entry per motif in the patterns[] array.
        (Gcompile): Likewise.
        (EGexecute): Loop through of array of patterns[] for a match.

2001-02-17  Alain Magloire

        From Bernd Strieder :
        # tail -f logfile | grep important | do_something_urgent
        # tail -f logfile | grep important | do_something_taking_very_long
        If grep does full buffering in these cases then the urgent operation
        does not happen as it should in the first case, and in the second case
        time is lost due to waiting for the buffer to be filled.
        This is clearly spoken not grep's fault in the first place, but libc's.
        There is a heuristic in libc that make a stream line-buffered only if a
        terminal is on the other end. This doesn't take care of the cases where
        this connection is somehow indirect.

        * src/grep.c (line_buffered): new option variable.
        (prline): if line_buffered is set fflush() is call.
        (usage): line_buffered new option.
        Input from Paul Eggert, doing setvbuf() may not be portable
        and breaks grep -z.

2001-02-16  Alain Magloire

        Patch from Isamu Hasegawa, for multibyte support.
        This patch prevent kwset_matcher from following problems.
        For example, in SJIS encoding, one character has the codepoint 0x895c.
        So the second byte of the character can match with '\' incorrectly.
        And in eucJP encoding, there are the characters whose codepoints are
        0xa5b9, 0xa5c8.  On the other hand, there is one character whose
        codepoint is 0xb9a5.  So 0xb9a5 can match with 2nd byte of 0xa5b9
        and 1st byte of 0xa5c8.

        * configure.in: Add check for mbrtowc.
        * src/search.c (check_multibyte_string): new function.
        Support for multibyte string.
        (EGexecute): call check_multibyte_string when kwset is set.
        (Fexecute): call to check_multibyte_string.
        (MBS_SUPPORT): new macro.

        Bugs noted and patched by Juan Manuel Guerrero.

2001-02-16  Alain Magloire

        A much requested feature, the possibility to select
        files when doing recurse :
        # find . -name "*.c" | xargs grep main {}
        # grep --include=*.c main .
        # find . -not -name "*.c" | xargs grep main {}
        # grep --exclude=*.c main .

        * src/grep.c (short_options): -R equivalent to -r.

        (Usage): Description of new options.
        (color): Rename color variable to color_option.
        Removed 'always|never|auto' arguments, not necessary for grep.
        (exclude_pattern): new variable, holder for the file pattern.
        (include_pattern): new variable, hoder for the file pattern.

        (prline): Now when color is set prline() will call the current matcher
        to find the offset of the matching string.
        * src/savedir.c: Take advantage of _DIRENT_HAVE_TYPE if supported.
        * src/search.c (EGexecute, Fexecute, Pexecute): Take a new argument

        * src/dfa.h (CRANGE): New enum value.  Comment fix.

        * src/dfa.c: Include <locale.h> if HAVE_SETLOCALE.
        Include "hard-locale.h".
        (prtok): Print CRANGE.
        (hard_LC_COLLATE): New static var.
        (lex): Return CRANGE when parsing a character range in a hard locale.
        Don't use strcoll; it's no longer needed and wasn't correct anyway.
        Use unsigned rather than token to hold unsigned chars.
        (addtok): Comment fix.
        (atom): Treat a CRANGE as if it were (.\1), approximately.
        (dfaparse): Initialize hard_LC_COLLATE.

        * src/Makefile.am (base_sources): Add hard-locale.c, hard-locale.h.

        textutils.

2000-08-20  Paul Eggert

        * tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Add LC_ALL=C, since
        some of the tests assume the C locale.

2000-08-16  Paul Eggert

        * src/search.c (Gcompile, Ecompile): -x overrides -w, for
        consistency with fgrep.  Don't assume that sizes fit in 'int'.
        Fix comments to match code.

2000-06-06  Paul Eggert

        * src/grep.c (grepdir): Don't look at st_dev when testing for
        Mingw32 bug.

2000-06-05  Paul Eggert

        Port to Mingw32, based on suggestions from Christian Groessler
        <cpg@aladdin.de>.

        * src/isdir.c: New file, taken from fileutils.

        * src/Makefile.am (base_sources): Add isdir.c.

        * src/grep.c (grepfile): Use isdir instead of doing it inline.
        (grepdir): Suppress ancestor check if the directory's inode and device
        are both zero, as that occurs only on Mingw32 which doesn't support
        inode or device.

        * src/system.h (isdir): New decl.
        (is_EISDIR): Depend on HAVE_DIR_EACCES_BUG, not D_OK.
        Use isdir, not access.

2000-06-02  Paul Eggert

        Problen noted by Gerald Stoller <gerald_stoller@hotmail.com>

        * src/grep.c (main): POSIX.2 says that -q overrides -l, which
        in turn overrides the other output options.  Fix grep to
        behave that way.

2000-05-27  Paul Eggert

        Simplify and tune the buffer allocation strategy.  Do not reserve a
        large save area: reserve only enough bytes to hold the residue, plus
        page alignment.  Put a newline sentinel before the buffer, for speed
        when searching backwards for newline.

        * src/grep.c (ubuffer, bufsalloc, PREFERRED_SAVE_FACTOR, page_alloc):
        Remove.  All uses changed.
        (INITIAL_BUFSIZE): New macro.
        (reset, fillbuf): Use simpler buffer allocation strategy.
        (reset): Check for preposterously large pagesize that would cause
        later calculations to overflow.
        (fillbuf): Do not resize buffer if there's room at the end for
        at least one more page.  This greatly increases performance when
        reading from non-regular files that contain no newlines.
        When growing the buffer, double its size instead of using a
        more complicated algorithm.
        (prtext, grep): Speed up by relying on the newline sentinel before the
        start of the buffer.
        (grep): When looking backwards for the last newline in a buffer,
        stop when we hit the residue, since it can't contain a newline.
        This avoids an O(N**2) algorithm when reading binary data from
        a pipe.  Use a sentinel to speed up the backward search for newline.
        (nlscan): Undo previous change; it wasn't needed and just complicates
        and slows down the code a tad.

2000-05-24  Paul Eggert

        Handle very large input counts better. Bug noted by Jim Meyering.

        * src/grep.c (totalcc, totalnl): Use uintmax_t, not off_t.
        (add_count): New function.
        (nlscan, prline, grep): Use it to check line and byte count overflows.
        (nlscan, grep): Don't keep track of counts when not asked to; this
        avoids unnecessary overflow diagnostics.
        (print_offset_sep): Now takes args of type uintmax_t and char,
        not off_t and int.

2000-05-16  Paul Eggert

        Problem reported by Bob Proulx <rwp@hprwp.fc.hp.com>, this patch
        is base on his finding, with appropiate corrections.

        * src/grep.c (main): Fix bug: -x and -w matched even when no
        patterns were specified.
        * tests/empty.sh: Test for -x and -w bug in grep 2.4.2.

2000-04-24  Paul Eggert

        POSIX.2 conformance fixes: grep -q now exits with status zero
        if an input line is selected, even if an error also occurs.
        grep -s no longer affects exit status.

        * src/grep.c (suppress_errors): Move definition earlier so
        that suppressible_error can use it.
        (suppressible_error): New function.
        (exit_on_match): New var.
        (grepbuf): If exit_on_match is nonzero, exit with status zero
        immediately.
        (grep, grepfile, grepdir): Invoke suppressible_error.
        (main): -q sets exit_on_match.

        * doc/grep.1, doc/grep.texi, NEWS:
        Document -q's behavior as required by POSIX.2.

        * tests/status.sh:
        Test for -q and -s behavior as conforming to POSIX.2.

2000-04-20  Paul Eggert

        * tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT):
        Set GREP_OPTIONS to the empty string.

2000-04-20  Paul Eggert

        * tests/status.sh: Fix typo: test -b -> test -r.

2000-04-20  Paul Eggert

        * src/dfa.c (lex):
        Do not assume that [c] is equivalent to [c-c]; this isn't true
        if LC_COLLATE specifies that some characters are equivalent.
        (setbit_case_fold): New function.
        (lex): Use it to simplify the code a bit.

2000-04-17  Paul Eggert

        Do CRLF munging only if HAVE_DOS_FILE_CONTENTS, instead of
        having it depend on O_BINARY (which leads to incorrect results
        on BeOS, VMS, and MacOS).

        * bootstrap/Makefile.try (DEFS): Add -DHAVE_DOS_FILE_CONTENTS.
        * src/system.h (SET_BINARY): Define only if HAVE_DOS_FILE_CONTENTS.
        (O_BINARY): Do not define.

        * m4/dosfile.m4: Define HAVE_DOS_FILE_CONTENTS if it appears we're
        using DOS.

        * src/grep.c (undossify_input, fillbuf, dosbuf.c, prline, main):
        Depend on HAVE_DOS_FILE_CONTENTS, not O_BINARY, when handling CRLF
        matters.
        (grepfile, main): Depend on SET_BINARY, not O_BINARY, when
        handling binary files on hosts that care about text versus binary.

2000-04-17  Paul Eggert

        * lib/getpagesize.h (getpagesize): Define to B_PAGE_SIZE if
        __BEOS__ is defined.  Based on a fix by Bruno Haible
        <haible@clisp.cons.org>.

2000-04-17  Bruno Haible

        * src/system.h [BeOS]: Ignore O_BINARY.
        * src/getpagesize.h [BeOS]: Define getpagesize() as B_PAGE_SIZE.

2000-04-10  Paul Eggert

        * doc/grep.1, doc/grep.texi, NEWS: -C now requires an operand.
        * src/grep.c (short_options, long_options, main, usage): Likewise.
        (context_length_arg): Renamed from ck_atoi.  Now reports an error
        and exits if the number is out of range for a context length.
        (get_nondigit_option): New function, which checks for overflow
        correctly, and which does not parse nonadjacent strings of digits
        into a single number.
        (main): Use get_nondigit_option instead of doing the code inline.
        With -A, -B, and -C, optarg is now guaranteed to be nonzero.

2000-04-08  Paul Eggert

        Now that we know that the input is always terminated by a
        newline before the matching algorithms see it, clean up the
        matching algorithms so that they no longer need to modify the
        input by inserting a sentinel newline, and no longer worry
        about running off the end of the buffer due to a missing sentinel.

        * src/grep.c (nlscan, prpending, prtext, grepbuf): Do not
        worry about running off the end of the input buffer, since
        it's now guaranteed to end in the sentinel newline.

        * src/dfa.c (prtok, dfasyntax, dfaparse, copy, merge, state_index,

        * src/search.c (Gcompile, Ecompile, EGexecute, Fcompile, Fexecute,
        Pcompile, Pexecute, kwsinit): Likewise.

        * src/search.c (Pcompile): Do not assume newly allocated
        storage is zeroed.

2000-04-06  Paul Eggert

        * doc/grep.1, doc/grep.texi, NEWS: Improve the explanation of
        locale-dependent behavior of range expressions.  Mention
        LC_COLLATE, since this affects range expressions.

2000-03-26  Paul Eggert

        * Makefile.am (ACINCLUDE_INPUTS): Add decl.m4, inttypes_h.m4,
        uintmax_t.m4, ulonglong.m4, xstrtoumax.m4.
        * m4/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Likewise.

        * src/Makefile.am (base_sources):
        Add xstrtol.c, xstrtol.h, xstrtoumax.c.
        (EXTRA_DIST): Add strtol.c.

        * configure.in (jm_AC_TYPE_UINTMAX_T, jm_AC_PREREQ_XSTRTOUMAX,
        HAVE_DECL_STRTOUL, HAVE_DECL_STRTOULL): Add.
        (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Add strtoul.

        * src/grep.c: Include xstrtol.h.
        (ck_atio): Use xstrtoumax and do proper overflow checking.
        (max_count, outleft): Now off_t, not int.
        (main): Likewise. Use xstrtoumax to convert max_count from string.

        * acconfig.h (HAVE_DECL_STRTOUL, HAVE_DECL_STRTOULL): New #undefs.
        (HAVE_STPCPY, ENABLE_NLS, HAVE_CATGETS, HAVE_GETTEXT,

        src/strtoumax.c, src/xstrtol.c, src/xstrtol.h, src/xstrtoumax.c:
        New files, taken unchanged from textutils, fileutils, sh-utils
        and/or tar.

2000-03-23  Paul Eggert

        * src/search.c (Pcompile): Add support for NUL bytes in
        Perl regular expressions.

2000-03-23  Paul Eggert

        * NEWS, doc/grep.1, doc/grep.texi: Change --pcre to --perl-regexp.
        * src/grep.c (long_options, usage): Likewise.

        * doc/grep.1, doc/grep.texi: Remove pgrep program.
        * src/Makefile.am (bin_PROGRAMS): Likewise.
        (pgrep_SOURCES): Remove.

        * src/grep.c (main): Rename matcher from "pgrep" to "perl".
        * src/search.c (matchers): Likewise.

        * src/search.c: Do not include stdio.h; no longer needed.
        (NILP): Remove.
        (sub): No longer static.
        (n_pcre): Remove.
        (cre): No longer an array.  Present only if HAVE_LIBPCRE.
        (extra): New variable.
        (Pcompile): Use fatal to report errors.
        This also removes a possible core dump.
        Add checks (marked FIXME) for restrictions in pcre.
        Use pcre_maketables for proper localized behavior.
        (Pcompile, Pexecute): Use GNU coding style.
        The argument is a single pattern, not a list of patterns separated
        by newlines; this is for consistency with grep and egrep.
        Use pcre_study for speed.
        (Pexecute): Abort if we lack pcre.
        Abort if pcre_exec reports an impossible error.
        Use code similar to the rest of search.c
        to narrow down to the line we've found.

2000-03-21  Alain Magloire

        * configure.in: added AC_CHECK_LIB(pcre, pcre_exec)
        * ChangeLog: Typos corrected.
        * src/search.c: new MACRO HAVE_LIBPCRE

2000-03-21  H.Merijn Brand

        * src/Makefile.am(bin_PROGRAMS): added pgrep and new macro
        pgrep_SOURCES.
        * src/search.c: new functions Pcompile() and Pexecute()
        to support PCRE.  Update matcher[] array for pgrep.
        * src/grep.c: new short and long option --pcre and -P.
        usage() updated.

2000-03-21  Bastiaan Stougie

        Improvement of the -m or --max-count option. Now works for NUM > 1 and
        prints trailing context for the last matching line.

        * src/grep.c
        (after_last_match): Is a new off_t variable that replaces inputhwm
        to retain the correct input offset even after a call to fillbuf. Note
        that after_last_match has a different meaning than inputhwm:
        it always points to the offset in the input of the first byte after
        the last matching line, and is 0 if no matching line has been found
        yet.
        (grep): Print trailing context after the NUMth match when the -m NUM
        option is used.
        (grep): Added comment. Should have been commented already.
        (grepbuf): Now updates outleft correctly. This fixes the bug that the
        -m NUM option did not stop after NUM lines for NUM greater than 1.
        (grepbuf, prtext): Now update after_last_match instead of inputhwm.
        (fillbuf): No longer updates inputhwm.
        (prpending): When outputting trailing context of the max_count-th
        matching line, stop at the first matching line.
        (grepfile): Seek to after_last_match or eof, depending on the values
        of outleft and bufmapped.
        (usage): added the -m or --max-count option to the help message.
        * doc/grep.texi, doc/grep.1: Document the change of the -m option.

2000-03-17  Paul Eggert

        Add new -m or --max-count option, based on a suggestion by
        Bastiaan Stougie.

        * doc/grep.texi, doc/grep.1: Document it.
        * src/grep.c (short_options, long_options, main): Add it.
        (inputhwm): New variable.
        (fillbuf, prtext, grepbuf): Set it.
        (bufmapped): Now a macro (defined to zero) if HAVE_MMAP is not defined.
        (max_count, outleft): New variables.
        (prtext, grepbuf, grep): Don't output more than outleft lines.
        (grepfile): If grepping standard input, seek to the limit of what
        we've read before exiting.  This fixes a bug with mmapped input,
        and is needed for proper -m support.
        (main): Exit immediately if -m 0 is specified.

2000-03-08  Alain Magloire

        * configure.in: version 2.4.2

2000-03-07  Paul Eggert

        * Make intl subdirectory match fileutils, tar, etc.;
        see intl/ChangeLog for details.

        * src/getpagesize.h: Reformat to match latest fileutils.

        * src/savedir.c (savedir): Work even if directory size is
        negative; this can happen with some NFS screwups.

2000-03-03  Jim Meyering

        * regex.m4: Make sure re_compile_pattern accepts patterns like `{1'.

2000-03-02  Alain Magloire

        * 2.4.1 Release

2000-02-25  Paul Eggert

        regex.c wasn't being passed through ansi2knr on pre-ANSI hosts.
        (ac_use_included_regex): Fix typo in warning.
        * src/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove regex.c, as the LIBOBJS
        workaround means that automake now puts regex.c into DIST_COMMON.

2000-02-25  Alain Magloire

        * po/*.po: update of the PO files.

2000-02-22  Eli Zaretskii

        * doc/grep.1:  Two small glitches(typos).

2000-02-18  Eli Zaretskii

        * djgpp/config.site (prefix, INSTALL): Use /dev/env/DJDIR instead
        of ${DJDIR}, so that the produced Makefile's work on any DJGPP
        installation.

2000-01-30 Alain Magloire

        * doc/grep.1:  corrected typo.
        Noted by Ruslan Ermilov.

2000-01-30 Alain Magloire

        * vms/Makefile.am: added config_vms.h to EXTRA_DIST.
        * vms/config_vms.h: New File, contains macros specific to VMS and
        avoid namespace collision with operating system supplied C library.
        * vms/make.com: Better compiler auto-detection; information for builds
        on pre-OpenVMS 7.x systems; general overhaul.
        * src/getpagesize.h: Reinstate support for different pagesizes on
        VAX and Alpha. Work around problem with DEC C compiler.
        * src/vms_fab.c: Cast to some assigments; fixed typo argcp vs. argp.
        * src/vms_fab.h: Added new include files to avoid warnings about
        undefined function prototypes.
        Those patches were provided by Martin P.J. Zinser (zinser@decus.de).

2000-01-30  Paul Eggert

        * src/grep.c (main): Update copyright notice.

2000-01-28  Alain Magloire

        * src/grep.c (usage):  The example "%s -i 'hello.*world' could
        lead to confusion when progname is 'fgrep.
        Noted by Akim Demaille.

        * configure.in: Reenable, jm_INCLUDE_REGEX() since we now
        track GNU lib C.
        * src/Makefile.am: EXTRA_DIST new macros with regex.c regex.h.
        Requested By Ulrich Drepper.

2000-01-25  Paul Eggert

        * src/grep.c (grep): If the final byte of an input file is not
        a newline, grep now silently supplies one.
        * doc/grep.texi, NEWS: Likewise.

2000-01-25  Paul Eggert

        * NEWS, doc/grep.1, doc/grep.texi: Add -I option.
        * src/grep.c (short_options, usage, main): Likewise.

        * doc/grep.texi: Fix some incorrect references to ASCII.

2000-01-25  Paul Eggert

        * doc/grep.1: Simplify synopsis; sort options; mention
        environment variables; clean up some minor gaffes.

2000-01-25  Paul Eggert

        * doc/grep.texi:
        Fix some errors in description of [:print:] and the like.

2000-01-23  Paul Eggert

        * src/dfa.c (FETCH, lex): Put brackets around if-body to avoid
        GCC warning about ambiguous if-then-else.

2000-01-23  Paul Eggert

        * src/regex.c (GET_UNSIGNED_NUMBER): Allow only ASCII digits.
        * src/dfa.c (ISASCIIDIGIT): New macro.
        (lex): Use it instead of ISDIGIT.

2000-01-23  Paul Eggert

        The bug is that regular expression ranges like [a-z] compare raw
        byte codes to the range boundaries, whereas POSIX says that they
        should use the current collating sequence instead.  For example,
        in Solaris 7 with LC_ALL=en_US, the command
        echo x | grep '[ -~]'
        outputs 'x', but it shouldn't output anything since ' ' and '~'
        sort before all letters in that locale.

        * src/regex.c (compile_range): When matching a character
        range, use the current collating sequence, as POSIX requires.
        * src/dfa.c (lex): Likewise.

2000-01-20  Alain Magloire

        * tests/Makefile.am (dist-hook): Added new rule to make sure
        that the shell scripts have the right permissions.
        * src/posix/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): added regex.h in the
        distribution.
        * THANKS: updated.

2000-01-18  Alain Magloire

        * Rectification the initial patch to add --binary-file option
        was done by Ruslan Ermilov.

2000-01-17  Paul Eggert

        Sync with sources of fileutils 4.0n, tar 1.13.17, glibc 2.1.3a1.
        Convert to ANSI C prototypes (using ansi2knr for backwards
        compatibility), as this makes it easier to sync.

        * configure.in (AC_OBJEXT): Spell in a funny way, to work around
        a bug in automake 1.4 with ansi2knr.
        (LIBOBJS): Add assignment so that .o files in LIBOBJS are also built
        via the ANSI2KNR-filtering rules.
        (AC_OUTPUT): Add src/posix/Makefile.
        * src/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Add ansi2knr.
        (SUBDIRS): New macro.
        * src/ansi2knr.1, src/ansi2knr.c, src/posix/Makefile.am: New files.
        * src/dfa.c, src/dosbuf.c, src/grep.c, src/kwset.c, src/search.c,
        src/vms_fab.c:
        Use prototypes for function definitions.
        * src/grep.c (main): Use int counter for default context,
        fixing an ANSI portability bug uncovered by the above changes.

        * config.guess, config.sub, install-sh, missing, src/alloca.c,
        src/getpagesize.h, src/memchr.c, src/savedir.c, src/savedir.h,
        src/stpcpy.c:
        Upgrade to latest version from fileutils 4.0n.

        * src/getopt.c, src/getopt.h, src/getopt1.c: Upgrade to latest
        version from tar 1.13.17.

        * src/obstack.c, src/obstack.h, src/regex.c, src/regex.h:
        Upgrade to glibc 2.1.3 alpha 1, with K&R C portability fix.
        * src/posix/regex.h: New file, from glibc 2.1.3 alpha 1.

2000-01-04  Paul Eggert

        Initial patch by Ruslan Ermilov.

        Add --binary-files option.
        * NEWS, doc/grep.1, doc/grep.texi: Document it.
        * src/grep.c (BINARY_FILES_OPTION): New constant.
        (long_options, grep, usage, main): New --binary-files option.
        (binary_files): New var.
        * src/system.h (TYPE_SIGNED, TYPE_MINIMUM, TYPE_MAXIMUM, CHAR_MAX):
        New macros.
        (INT_MAX, UCHAR_MAX): Define in terms of TYPE_MAXIMUM.

2000-01-04  Paul Eggert

        * savedir.c (savedir): Don't store past the end of an array if
        name_size is zero and the directory is empty.
        Reported by Dima Barsky <dima@pwd.hp.com>.

1999-12-03  Alain Magloire

        * 2.4 Release.

1999-11-18  Paul Eggert

        * m4/largefile.m4 (AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_FLAGS): Work around a
        problem with the QNX 4.25 shell, which doesn't propagate exit
        status of failed commands inside shell assignments.

1999-11-13  Eli Zaretskii

        * doc/grep.texi: Minor markup and spelling corrections.  Use
        @noindent where appropriate.

        * PATCHES-{AM,AC}: rename to PATCHES.{AM,AC}

1999-11-12  Eli Zaretskii

        doc/grep.texi: Minor fixes and typos corrected.
        djgpp/README: Updated version.

1999-11-07  Paul Eggert

        * src/grep.c (usage): Fix misspelling.

1999-11-07  Paul Eggert

        Don't assume that the C library has re_set_syntax and friends.
        * src/Makefile.am (base_sources): Add regex.c, regex.h.
        (EXTRA_DIST): Remove regex.c, regex.h.

        * src/grep.c (prtext): Use out_quiet, not not_text, to decide
        whether to set pending to zero at the end.
        (not_text): Remove static variable, undoing latest change.
        (grep): Likewise.

        * doc/grep.texi: Tighten up the text, and fix some minor
        spelling and usage errors.  Use @enumerate rather than @table
        @samp, since it's better for Q&A format.  Add cross
        references.

1999-11-01 Alain Magloire

        * src/search.c: Use the more portable [[:alnum:]]
        to define a word instead of Ascii dependent [0-9A-Za-z]
        * src/grep.c: make not_text global to not display text when
        the context switches -A/-B/-C are use on binary files.
        * make grep-2.3g available for testing.
        * configure.in: drop support for --without-included-regex.
        This was generating bogus bug reports, since many GNU/Linux
        users have different version of glibc.  And glibc maintainers
        decided to drop k&r support.

1999-11-01 Arnold D. Robbins

        * regex.c (init_syntax_once): move below definition of
        ISALNUM etc., then use ISALNUM to init the table, so that
        the word ops will work if i18n'ed.
        (SYNTAX): And subscript with 0xFF for Latin-1 characters.

1999-10-26  Alain Magloire

        * src/regex.c: Merge changes from GNU lib C.
        * Updated the *.po files

1999-10-26  Paul Eggert

        * src/grep.c (fillbuf): Don't report buffer size overflow if
        newalloc == save and maxalloc == save.  This can happen
        e.g. when reading a large page-aligned file that contains
        no newlines.

1999-10-21  Paul Eggert

        * src/grep.c (usage): Give example.  Clarify -F.
        Explain exit status more clearly.

1999-10-12  Paul Eggert

        * doc/grep.texi: Shorten the commentary about egrep and {.
        "BSD grep" -> "traditional grep".
        * doc/grep.1: Match recent changes to grep.texi.

1999-10-11  Paul Eggert

        * NEWS, doc/grep.1, doc/grep.texi: New option --mmap.
        * src/grep.c (mmap_option): New variable.
        (long_options, reset, usage): Add --mmap.
        Default is now read, not mmap.

        * doc/grep.1: Document -Z or --null.

1999-10-11  Paul Eggert

        * doc/grep.texi: Fix texinfo glitches.  POSIX -> POSIX.2 where
        appropriate.

1999-10-11  Paul Eggert

        * acconfig.h (ssize_t): New #undef.

        * configure.in (AC_CHECK_TYPE): Add ssize_t.

        * src/grep.c (PREFERRED_SAVE_FACTOR): New macro.
        (reset): If the buffer has already been allocated, set bufsalloc to
        be bufalloc / PREFERRED_SAVE_FACTOR.  This avoids problems when
        bufsalloc == bufalloc (possible after reading a large binary file).
        (reset): Use PREFERRED_SAVE_FACTOR instead of magic constant.
        Do not set bufbeg; nobody uses it.
        Always set buflim.
        Check for lseek error.
        Use SEEK_CUR, not a magic constant.
        (fillbuf): Return an error indication, not a count.
        All callers changed.
        Do not assume ssize_t fits in int.
        Use PREFERRED_SAVE_FACTOR instead of magic constant.
        Clean up mmap code.
        Do not attempt to mmap zero bytes.
        Check for lseek error.
        Use SEEK_SET, not a magic constant.
        Work correctly if read is interrupted.
        (grepfile): Work correctly if open or close is interrupted.

        * src/system.h (SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR): New macros.

1999-10-02 Alain Magloire

        * src/regex.[ch]: upgrade from GNU lib C source tree.

        * make beta 2.3f available.

1999-10-02  Paul Eggert

        * NEWS: egrep is now equivalent to `grep -E'.
        The lower bound of an interval is not optional.
        You can specify a matcher multiple types without error.
        -u and -U are now allowed on non-DOS hosts, and have no effect.
        * doc/grep.texi: Likewise.
        * doc/grep.1: Likewise.
        Fix some troff bugs that prevented `groff' from rendering the page.

        * src/egrepmat.c, src/fgrepmat.c, src/grepmat.c (default_matcher):
        Remove.
        (matcher): Add.
        * src/grep.h (default_matcher): Remove.
        (matcher): Now exported from ?grepmat.c, not grep.c.

        * src/dfa.c (lex): If { would start an invalid interval specification,
        treat it as a normal character.
        Remove (broken) support for {,M} meaning {0,M}.
        Diagnose bogus intervals like {1,0}.
        (closure): maxrep is now -1 to indicate no limit, not zero;
        zero is a valid value for maxrep, meaning an upper bound of zero.

        * src/grep.c (short_options): New constant.
        (long_options, main): -u and -U are now supported on Unix,
        with no effect.
        (matcher): Removed; now defined by ?grepmat.c.
        (install_matcher): Renamed from setmatcher.
        (setmatcher): New function.
        (usage): Report new, more uniform option scheme.
        (main): Do not initialize matcher; ?grepmat.c now does this.
        Rely on setmatcher to catch matcher conflicts.
        Default matcher is "grep".

        * src/search.c (matchers):
        Remove "posix-egrep" matcher; no longer needed.
        (Ecompile): Likewise.
        The egrep matcher now has POSIX behavior.

        * tests/bre.tests: grep '\{' is no longer an error.
        Fix test for interval too large, and enable it.
        * tests/ere.tests: grep -E {1 is no longer an error
        Likewise for a{1, a{1a, a{1a}, a{1,x}.

1999-09-22  Paul Eggert

        * largefile.m4 (AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_FLAGS): Work around GCC
        2.95.1 bug with HP-UX 10.20.

1999-09-12  Paul Eggert

        * src/grep.c (fillbuf): Fix typo: we sometimes reported
        arithmetic overflow even when there wasn't any.

1999-09-12  Paul Eggert

        * configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Add memmove.

        * src/system.h (S_ISREG): New macro.
        (memmove): Define if ! defined HAVE_MEMMOVE && ! defined memmove,
        not if !defined STDC_HEADERS.  This is needed for SunOS 4.1.4,
        which defines STDC_HEADERS but lacks memmove.

        * src/grep.c (bufoffset): Needed even if !defined HAVE_MMAP.
        (reset): Always fstat the file, since we always need its size if it is
        regular.
        Similarly, get the buffer offset of every regular file.
        Set bufmapped to 0 if the file's initial offset is not a multiple
        of the page size.
        (fillbuf): Calculate an upper bound on how much memory we should
        allocate only for regular files, since we don't know the sizes of
        other files.
        Don't bother to check whether the file offset is a multiple of the page
        size, since we now do that just once in `reset'.
        When an mmapped area would fall past the end of the file, trim it to
        just before instead of giving up immediately and doing a `read';
        that avoids a worst-case behavior that could read half an mmapped file.
        Fix bug when computing offsets on hosts that don't have mmap.

1999-08-27  Paul Eggert

        * src/system.h (memmove): New macro.

        * src/grep.c (page_alloc): Reallocate the old buffer instead
        of having both old and new buffers active simultaneously.
        Remove valloc debugging variant, which no longer applies.

        (fillbuf): Rejigger the buffer allocation mechanism.  The old
        mechanism could allocate more than 10*N bytes for an N-byte
        file, which was excessive.  Check for arithmetic overflow a
        bit more carefully.

1999-08-25  Paul Eggert

        * src/grep.c (grepdir):
        Don't assume that st_ino and st_dev must be integers;
        POSIX.1 allows them to be floating-point (!).

        * src/vms_fab.h (arr_ptr): `:' -> `;' to fix typo.

1999-08-18  Alain Magloire

        * 2.3e snapshot.

1999-08-18  Alain Magloire

        * src/search.c: On a CRAY J90 system running UNICOS 8.0.
        Compilation of ./src/search.c failed because the declaration of
        the variable "regex":
          static struct re_pattern_buffer regex;
        conflicted with a previous declaration search.c #includes "system.h",
        which #includes <stdlib.h>, which declares :
        extern char *regex __((char *_Re, char *_Subject, ...));
        The declaration in search.c is local to that one source file.
        I just changed its name to something less likely to conflict.
        (I called it "regexbuf", but you could pick any name you want.)
        Excerpt email from Dean Kopesky.

1999-08-16  Paul Eggert

        Upgrade large-file support to the version used in tar and
        textutils.

        * Makefile.am (ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): Define to be empty.
        (M4DIR, ACINCLUDE_INPUTS): New macros.
        ($(srcdir)/acinclude.m4): New rule.

        * configure.in (AC_CANONICAL_HOST, AM_C_PROTOTYPES): Add.
        (AC_SYS_LARGEFILE): Renamed from AC_LFS, for compatibility
        with what should appear in the next autoconf release.

        * m4/largefile.m4: Renamed from m4/lfs.m4.

        * src/ansi2knr.1, src/ansi2knr.c, config.guess, config.sub:
        New files.  config.guess and config.sub ar needed by the new
        AC_SYS_LARGEFILE.  ansi2knr is needed by AM_C_PROTOTYPES,
        which in turn is needed by the new AC_SYS_LARGEFILE.

1999-08-16  Alain Magloire

        * 2.3d snapshot on ftp server.

1999-07-26  Paul Eggert

Several GNU tools have options to process arbitrary file names, even
file names that contain newline characters.  These include `find
-print0', `perl -0', `sort -z', and `xargs -0'.  It'd be handy if GNU
grep also processed such file names.  Here's a proposed patch to do
this, relative to grep 2.3c.  This patch introduces two options, one
for the data, and one for the file names.  (Sometimes one wants
null-terminated file names in the output, and sometimes one wants to
process lists of null-terminated strings, and these are orthogonal
axes.)

        * NEWS, doc/grep.texi: New -z or --null-data and -Z or --null options.
        * src/grep.c (long_options, usage, main): Likewise.

        * src/dfa.h (dfasyntax): New eol parameter.
        * src/dfa.c (eolbyte): New var.
        (dfasyntax): Set it from new parameter.
        (lex, dfastat, build_state, dfaexec): Use it instead of '\n'.

        * src/grep.h (eolbyte): New decl.
        * src/grep.c (eolbyte): New var.
        (nlscan, prpending, prtext, grepbuf, grep): Use it instead of '\n'.
        (filename_mask): New var.
        (prline, grepfile): Output NUL separator if filename_mask is zero.
        (grep): Look for '\200' as the hallmark of a binary file, not '\0',
        if -z or --null-data is specified, since it implies that '\0' is
        expected as text.

        * src/search.c (Gcompile, Ecompile): Pass eolbyte to dfasyntax.
        (EGexecute, Fexecute): Use eolbyte instead of '\n'.

1999-06-15 Alain Magloire

        * src/grep.c, doc/grep{1,texi} :
        --revert-match should be --invert-match.
        Correction proposed by Karl Berry.

1999-06-12 Alain Magloire

        * doc/grep.{1,texi}: add description for --with-filename.
        Noted missing by UEBAYASHI Masao.

1999-03-17 Paul Eggert

        * NEWS: Add GREP_OPTIONS.

        * doc/grep.texi: Document GREP_OPTIONS, and the other
        environment variables.  Fix doc for [:blank:], [:cntrl:], [:punct:].

        * src/grep.c (prepend_args, prepend_default_options): New functions.
        (main): Use them to implement GREP_OPTIONS.
        * src/system.h (getenv): New decl.

1999-03-16 Volker Borchert

        * configure.in: Use case case ... esac for  checking Visual C++.
        When ${CC} contains options it was not recognize.

1999-03-07 Paul Eggert

        * src/grep.c (usage): Don't report -E, -F, and -G unless we're grep.
        (main): Don't match options -E, -F, and -G unless we're grep.
        Remove after-the-fact check for options -E, -F, and -G, since
        they're no longer needed.

1999-03-05  Eli Zaretskii

        * src/grep.c (main): Print the name of the default matcher instead
        of just "grep".

1999-02-06 Alain Magloire

        * tests/*.awk : Linux users are seeing "Broken Pipe" on make check.
        The problem is that grep does not drain its stdin, thus the previous
        process in the pipeline receives a SIGPIPE.  Other shells are silent
        about this.  There is actually no failure, since the broken pipe is
        expected.  You can work around it by changing the pipeline, so that
        the input is drained, like this:
        status=`echo 'check' | { ${GREP} -E -e pattern >/dev/null 2>&1;
        echo $?; cat >/dev/null; }`; if test $status -ne $errnu then ... fi
        Excerpt email from Andreas Schwab.

1999-02-23 Alain Magloire

        * src/grep.c : Restrict the use of -E, -F, -G
        to only grep driver, Posix behaviour. {f,e}grep
        the matcher is already set. This change may brake
        scripts, warn in NEWS.

        * doc/grep.{1,texi} : -C takes arguments, upgrade manual.

        * beta 2.3a

1999-02-23 Alain Magloire

        * configure.in : Change the configure VC test from
        'test x$ac_cv_prog_CC = xcl;' to 'test x"$ac_cv_prog_CC" = xcl;'
        Email from Joshua R. Poulson.

1999-02-23 Paul Eggert

        Fix porting bug reported by Amakawa Shuhei for SunOS 4.1.4-JL.
        The btowc.c shipped with grep 2.3 is incorrect for Solaris
        2.5.1 and earlier, as it assumes UTF8, which these OSes do not
        support.  Solaris 7 supports btowc, so there's no need to ship
        a substitute for it.  The only questionable case is Solaris
        2.6, which lacks btowc but does support UTF8.  However, 2.6
        supports UTF8 but only as a demonstration (for an English
        locale!); Japanese Solaris 2.6 users typically use EUC, or
        sometimes shift-JIS, but they cannot use UTF8 since Japanese
        UTF8 is not supported.  Hence there's no point to having grep
        substitute a btowc that uses UTF8, as it is either redundant,
        or it will almost invariably have incorrect behavior.

        * configure.in (AC_CHECK_HEADERS): Don't set USE_WCHAR.
        (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Add btowc, wctype.
        (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Don't replace btowc; our replacement is
        invariably doing the wrong thing anyway, at least on SunOS/Solaris.
        Don't bother to check for wctype in -lw, as we don't support
        wide characters on Solaris 2.5.1 or earlier anyway.

        * bootstrap/Makefile.try (OBJS): Remove btowc.$(OBJEXT).

        * src/btowc.c: Removed; no longer needed.

1999-02-19  Paul Eggert

        * NEWS: Fix typo when talking about the old behavior of
        silently skipping directories; it was grep 2.1, not grep 2.2.

1999-02-15 Alain Magloire

        * bootstrap/Makefile.try : add DJGPP DEFS.
        Done by Elie Zaretsckii.

        * release of 2.3.

1999-02-10 Alain Magloire

        * bootstrap/{Makefile{try,am},REAMDE} : skeleton
        provided for system lacking the tools to autoconfigure.

        * src/{e,f,}grepmat.c: added guard [HAVE_CONFIG_H]

1999-02-10 Alain Magloire

        * PATCHES-AC, PATCHES-AM: updated.

        * m4/regex.m4 : updated.

1999-02-05 Eli Zaretskii

        * m4/gettext.m4 : Support DOS-style D:/foo/bar absolute file
        names.

        * aclocal.m4 (DJGPP) : Use $DJ_GPP instead, since changing the
        latter prevents GCC from finding headers and libraries.

        * djgpp/config.bat: Make building from another directory work

        * djgpp/config.sed: Remove redundant command wich edited path
        separator: now done by configure.

        * src/btowc.c : protect for wchar.h

1999-01-28 Alain Magloire

        * intl/Makefile.in: Replace .o with .${ac_objext} where necessary.
        Work around a limitation of Visual C++ on Cygwin32.
        * acconfig.h configure.in: Define `alloca' as `_alloca' when CC=cl.
        This little hack was suggested by Ian Roxborough <irox@cygnus.com>.
        Patch forwarded by Ben Elliston.

1999-01-28 Alain Magloire

        * PATCHES-AM: New file. A small patch for automake-1.4, use $(sep)
        as the path separator base on @SEP@.
        * PATCHES-AC configure.in : updated for autoconf-13.

1999-01-27 Volker Borchert

        * grep.c: fgrep -NUM not working correctly.
        add the argument number to digit_args_val.

1999-01-22 Paul Eggert

        Prevent grep -r from recursing infinitely through directory loops via
        symbolic links.

        * grep.c (struct stats): New type.
        (stats_base): New var.
        (bufstat): Remove; subsumed by stats->stat.
        (reset, fillbuf, grep, grepdir, grepfile): Pass struct stats * arg,
        for directory loop checking; use this instead of the bufstat global.
        All callers changed.
        (grepfile): Stat the file before invoking grepdir.
        (grepdir): Assume that the argument has already been statted.
        No longer a need for a directory size argument, since it
        can be gotten from the struct stats * argument.
        Check for directory loops.
        Create linked list of directories currently being visited,
        to detect loops.

1998-12-29 Kaveh R. Ghazi

        intl/localealias.c: When building grep-2.2e using cc on Irix4,
        I needed the following patch to intl/localealias.c.
        (Its the same patch used by fileutils-4.0.) The patch resolves
        conflicts between char* and unsigned char* in the i18n code.

1998-12-10 Alain Magloire

        * src/grep.c : Typo in contex -->context

        * acconfig.h: (HAVE_DOS_FILENAME)

        * TODO: updated.

        * src/search.c: remove obsolete 'gegrep,ggrep,gnugrep'
        matchers. grep no longer depend on argv[0].

        * grep-2.2e beta to test DJGPP port.

1998-11-28  Paul Eggert

        Various portability enhancements:
        - Don't assume that O_BINARY implies DOS.  Use separate
        macros D_OK (for DOS-like directory access) and
        HAVE_DOS_FILE_NAMES (for DOS-like file names).
        - Don't assume that off_t fits into long; it doesn't on Solaris 2.6.
        - Have is_EISDIR set errno properly on hosts with screwed-up EISDIR.
        - Treat ':' specially in DOS file names only if it's the end of a
        drive specifier.
        - Protect against errno < 0.

        * src/grep.c (is_EISDIR): Move defn to system.h.
        (print_offset_sep): New function.
        (fillbuf): Remove redundant test of O_BINARY.
        (totalcc, totalnl): Now of type off_t.
        (prline): Use print_offset_sep to print file offsets.
        (grepfile): Don't set e to EISDIR; that's is_EISDIR's responsibility
        on machines that don't work properly with EISDIR.
        (grepdir): Don't assume ':' means slash on all DOS filenames;
        it means it only in the file prefix.

        * src/system.h (strerror): Check for negative error numbers.
        (is_EISDIR): Depend on D_OK, not O_BINARY.
        (SET_BINARY): Depend on HAVE_SETMODE, not __DJGPP__.
        (IS_SLASH, FILESYSTEM_PREFIX_LEN): Depend on HAVE_DOS_FILE_NAMES,
        not O_BINARY.
        (CHAR_BIT): New macro.

        * src/dosbuf.c (struct dos_map):
        pos and add members are now of type off_t.
        (dos_stripped_crs): Now of type off_t.
        (dossified_pos): Now accepts arg and returns value of type off_t.

        * configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): Add setmode.
        (HAVE_DOS_FILENAMES): New macro

1998-11-27  Eli Zaretskii

        * djgpp/config.sed: New file, a Sed script to edit configure
        script before running it on DOS/Windows.
        * djgpp/config.bat: Updated to handle po2tbl.sed.in and
        po/Makefile.in.in on DOS filesystems, and to run config.sed.

1998-11-24  Jim Meyering

        * src/grep.c : Typo s/infalid/invalid/
        Also noted by Stanislav Brabec.

1998-11-24  Eli Zaretskii

        * doc/grep.texi: I found and corrected several typos.
        I believe the GNU standards require the section that describes the
        options to the programs to be called ``Invoking'' or ``Invoking
        <program-name>''.  This is so users and programs can easily find
        that node in any Info file.  So I changed the name of the
        `Options' chapter to `Invoking', and corrected the
        cross-references accordingly.
        I added some markup to things like file names and options.
        I added some additional index entries where that seemed useful.
        I also corrected some index entries, such as "@cindex [:alnum:]",
        which used a colon in them (the colons confuse Info readers).

1998-11-24  Alain Magloire

        * grep/doc/grep.texi : -h is not use for help.
        Nit spotted by Jim Meyering.

        with limited file system aka DOS.

        * grep-2.2d release for beta.

1998-11-16  Paul Eggert

        Remove memory leak with valloced buffers, by invoking malloc instead.

        * configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS), src/system.h (valloc): Remove.
        * src/grep.c (page_alloc): New function.
        (ubuffer, pagesize): New vars.
        (ALIGN_TO): New macro.
        (reset): Initialize new vars.  Check for overflow in buffer size calc.
        Use page_alloc instead of valloc.
        (fillbuf): Likewise.  Use memcpy to copy saved area.

1998-11-15  Paul Eggert

        * dfa.c (dfacomp), search.c (EGexecute): Don't assume char is unsigned.

1998-11-14  Paul Eggert

        * src/grep.c (grepdir): Fix bug: memory freed twice.

        * src/search.c (Gcompile, Ecompile): Don't invoke dfainit,
        since dfacomp does it for us, and if we also do it then we
        leak memory.

1998-11-13  Eli Zaretskii

        * djgpp/config.bat: Rewrite to run the configure script via Bash.
        * djgpp/config.site, djgpp/getconf: New files.

        (is_EISDIR): Define it here for DOS and Windows.

        * src/grep.c (main) [O_BINARY]: Set stdout to binary mode, so the
        EOL formats of the input and output files match, unless stdout is
        the console device.
        (is_EISDIR): Don't define if already defined.  Accept a second
        argument, the file name; all callers changed.
        (grepdir): Don't free `file', inside the loop.  Use IS_SLASH to
        check whether `dir' needs a slash.
        (grepfile): If file is a directory, set e to EISDIR.

1998-11-10  Alain Magloire

        * src/vms_fab.{c,h}: New file for VMS wildcard expansion
        Written by Phillip C. Brisco.

        * vms/make.com : add line to compile vms_fab.c and
        {e,f,}grepmat.c with link for each grep/fgrep/egrep.
        Base on patch send by Phillib C. Brisco.

1998-11-09  Alain Magloire

        from the RCS Id.

        * src/grep.c (is_EISDIR): New macro.
        (grep): If -s, suppress errors from trying to read directories.
        (grepfile): Use is_EISDIR to simplify code.
        (grepdir): If -s, suppress errors from trying to read directories.

        * src/grep.1: Fix -q -r -s problems; describe BSD grep better.

        * src/grep.c (main): Update copyright.

        Specify default matcher with default_matcher extern var, not
        DEFAULT_MATCHER macro.  This is more straightforward and means
        we need to compile grep.c just once.

        * src/egrepmat.c, src/fgrepmat.c, src/grepmat.c: New files.

        * src/Makefile.am (base_sources): New macro.

        (fgrep.o, egrep.o): Remove.

        * src/grep.h (matcher): Now char const *.
        (default_matcher): New decl.

        * src/grep.c (matcher): Now char const *.
        (setmatcher): Now accepts char const *.
        (main): Default the matcher from default_matcher (linked externally)
        rather than DEFAULT_MATCHER (a macro).

1998-11-08 Alain Magloire

        * src/grep.1: `prep.ai.mit.edu' should be replaced with `gnu.org'.
        Nit from Paul Eggert.

1998-11-06 Alain Magloire

        * src/grep.c: The Matcher is not set to argv[0] but

1998-11-04 Miles Bader

        * src/grep.c (main): Rationalize interaction of -C/-NUM/-A/-B
        options, and allow -C to have an optional argument. -NUM can
        now be mixed with -C, and -A, -B always take precedence over
        -C/-NUM, regardless of order.
        (long_options): Let -C/--context take an optional argument.

1998-11-03 Alain Magloire

        * src/dfa.c: HP-UX define clrbit/setbit as macros in <sys/param.h>
        #undef if defined.
        Fixed by Andreas Ley and Philippe Defert.

        * src/grep.1 : mention that -s follows POSIX.2 behavior.
        Noted by Paul Eggert and others.

        * tests/khadafy.sh: a typo in failure(s).
        Spotted By Sotiris Vassilopoulos.

1998-11-01  Paul Eggert

        * src/system.h (IN_CTYPE_DOMAIN): New macro.
        (ISALPHA, ISUPPER, ISLOWER, ISDIGIT, ISXDIGIT, ISSPACE,
        ISPUNCT, ISALNUM, ISPRINT, ISGRAPH, ISCNTRL): Use
        IN_CTYPE_DOMAIN instead of isascii.

1998-08-18  Paul Eggert

        Add support for new -r or --recursive (or -d recurse or

        (reset): Initialize it.
        (fillbuf): Use it.
        (count_matches, list_files, no_filenames, suppress_errors): New static
        vars; formerly were local to `main'.
        (grep): Recurse through directories if the user asks for this.
        (usage, main): Add new options.
        (main): Change some local vars to be static, as described above.
        Move most of the guts into grepfile function.
        so that it can be recursed through.

        * configure.in (AC_HEADER_DIRENT, AC_FUNC_CLOSEDIR_VOID): Add.
        (AC_REPLACE_FUNCS): Add stpcpy.

        * src/savedir.c, src/savedir.h, src/stpcpy.c: New files;

        Skip the file if it's a directory and we're skipping directories.
        (grep): Skip the file if `reset' tells us to.
        (main): If open fails because the file is a directory, and if we're
        skipping directories, don't report an error.
        Remove special case for DOS and Windows.

        * src/dosbuf.c (guess_type): Use the same method for guessing whether a
        file is binary as grep.c's grep does.
        There's no longer any need to declare `bp' to be unsigned.

1998-04-26 Alain Magloire

        * grep-2.2 release.

        * src/dfa.c: Wrong revision was pulled out
        for beta 2.1.1d.
        * src/search.c: Wrong revision was pulled out
        for beta 2.1.1d.

        * src/grep.c: ck_atoi () added instead of atoi ().
        Suggestion from Jim Meyering.
        ck_atoi () pulled from diffutils-2.7, maintained by Paul Eggert.

        * AUTHORS: Rephrase of some sentences.
        * README:  Rewording.
        Noted and patched by Joel N. Weber II.

1998-04-17 Kaveh R. Ghazi

        * src/dfa.h: Don't define `const', trust autoconf to handle it.

1998-04-16 Alain Magloire

        * tests/{status,empty}.sh: wrong return status.

        * src/grep.c: Remove the REGEX part in usage (), it was
        consider overkill by most.

1998-04-14  Eli Zaretskii

        * djgpp/config.bat: Support file names with multiple dots on all
        platforms.

        * djgpp/README: Add instructions about file names illegal on
        MS-DOS.

1998-04-13 Alain Magloire

        * src/dfa.c: by "popular" demand reverse
        back to '_' not word-constituent.

        * grep-2.1.1c available for testing.

1998-04-13  Karl Heuer

        * src/grep.c: (a) The directory check is done too early:
        logically, if the argument is "-", then it refers to standard
        input, regardless of whether there's something in the file
        system answering to "-".
        (b) The sh command "grep -l root /etc/passwd /etc/group 0<&-"
        prints "(standard input)" instead of "/etc/passwd", because it
        mistakenly believes that a named file will never be opened on fd
        0.  The string "(standard input)" should be based on the file
        having been originally specified as "-", rather than making
        assumptions about the fd.
        (c) the code that calls close(fd) is being done outside of the
        test for a bad fd.  Thus, if the open failed, this code will
        attempt to close(-1).  It should be done inside the "fd != -1"
        branch.
        This patch addresses all three of these problems.

1998-04-13 Alain Magloire

        * configure.in: remove the deprecated AC_ISC_POSIX macro.
        Spotted by Karl Heuer.

1998-04-03  Eli Zaretskii

        * djgpp/main.mak, djgpp/src.mak, djgpp/tests.mak: Updated from the
        relevant Makefile.in files.

        * djgpp/config.bat: Create files in intl directory like the
        configure script does.

1998-03-28  Eli Zaretskii

        * djgpp/main.mak, djgpp/src.mak, djgpp/tests.mak: Updated to track
        changes in respective Makefile.in files.

        * src/dosbuf.c (guess_type): Avoid running off the end of the
        buffer.  Spotted by Paul Eggert.

1998-03-27  Alain Magloire

        * grep-2.1.1b.tar.gz available.

        * src/regex.c: CLASS_CHAR_MAX set to 256 instead of 6
        when WCTYPE and WCHAR are not defined. When class names
        where bigger then 6, it will not detect an error.
        example '[[:alphabet:]]'.

        * Updated the copyright of the files with emacs.
        With emacs Jim :).

1998-03-26 Jim Meyering

        * src/dfa.c (IS_WORD_CONSTITUENT): Define.
        (lex): Use IS_WORD_CONSTITUENT, not ISALNUM.
        Don't special-case '_'.
        (dfastate): Use IS_WORD_CONSTITUENT, not ISALNUM.
        (dfaexec): Likewise.

1998-03-25  Alain Magloire

        * tests/warning.sh: typos and replace the echos with
        a simple cat.
        Noted By Jim Meyering.

        * src/regex.c: #undef ISASCII and ISPRINT before defining
        them(On Solaris it was define).
        Pattern 'a[[:]:]]b' is an invalid char class and the error
        from regex was 1(REG_NOMATCH) instead of 2 (REG_ECTYPE).
        Fix with help from Ulrich Drepper.

        * src/grep.c (usage): Ulrich wrote: "A single printf should
        not have more than 900 bytes. For translation reasons the
        text shouldn't be split in too many pieces since this is
        tiresome and also does not help to generate a consistent picture."
        Noted by Ulrich Drepper.
        * src/grep.c (usage): Dig out and old patch from
        Franc,ois to explain the regex in usage().
        Ideas from Franc,ois Pinard.

1998-03-23 Alain Magloire

        * testing: grep-2.1.1a for testing.

        * configure.in: Solaris needs '-lw' if we use wchar/wctype
        functions.
        * src/btowc.c: New file from GNU libc. Solaris 2.5 don't
        have it define.
        * configure.in : check for btowc ().

        * regex.c: Include <wchar.h> before <wctype.h>, to work around
        a Solaris 2.5 bug.
        Patch provided by Paul Eggert.

        * tests/status.sh: new file to check return status code.
        * tests/empty.sh: new file to check for empty pattern.
        * tests/warning.sh: new file to tell where to report errors.

        * configure.in: If available, prefer support for large files
        unless the user specified one of the CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, or LIBS
        variables.
        Done by Paul Eggert.

        * src/grep.c (usage): change prep.ai.mit.edu for gnu.org.

1998-03-18 Alain Magloire

        * src/grep.c (usage): Formating the --help message a bit off.
        Noted by William Bader.

        * src/grep.c (main): When checking conflicting matcher for option -E the
        matcher was to "egrep" instead of "posix-egrep".
        Reported by kwzh@gnu.org.

        * src/grep.c: Typos and rewording the --help message.
        Reported by Karl Heuer.

        * src/grep.1: The man page wording :
          A regular expression matching a single character may be
          followed by one of several repetition operators:
        is unclear since 'x(yz)*z' is a valid regex.
        Remove the "matching a single character".
        Suggested by Harald Hanche-Olsen.

        * src/grep.c (main): `-f /dev/null' now specifies no patterns
        and therfore matches nothing.
        Reported by Jorge Stolfi.
        Patched by Paul Eggert.

1998-03-10 Alain Magloire

        * Ice storm 98(el nino). Lost grep repository disk,
        and my $HOME directory, etc ..
        Trying to get the emails/patch from dejanews.com
        and start from grep-2.1.
        sigh ....

1997-11-01 Alain Magloire

        * src/grep.c: For the long options, the problems are:
        --file appears in the option table as 'no_argument'
        instead of 'required_argument'.
        --files-with-matches is missing from the option table.
        The help lists '--fixed-strings' as the long option for -F,
        the table has '--fixed-regexp'.
        --regexp appears in the option table as 'no_argument'
        instead of 'required_argument'.
        --with-filename is missing from the option table.
        Reported by Grant McDorman and Krishna Sethuraman.

1997-10-19 Alain Magloire

        * src/grep.c: the option "with-filename was not in the arg table.
        Corrected by Jim Hand.

        * GNU gettext library from gettext-0.10.32.

        * src/grep.c: reverse back to greping directories,
        One could skip the error message by defining
        SKIP_DIR_ERROR. There is no clear way of doing
        things, I hope to setle this on the next majore release
        Thanks Paul Eggert, Eli Zaretskii and gnits for the
        exchange.

        * tests/status.sh: add this check to make sure
        That the return status code is ok.

1997-10-10 Andreas Schwab

        * src/grep.1: Fix formatting.

        * configure.in: Check for wctype.h, wchar.h, libintl.h and
        isascii, which are needed for regex.c.

1997-10-01 Paul Eggert

        * src/grep.c (fillbuf): Don't warn about mmap failures.

1997-09-7 Alain Magloire

        * src/grep.c: added code for -H --with-filename.

        * djgpp/*: patch wrongly apply
        duplication of text in djgpp/{README,config.h}.
        Filter djgpp/config.bat with unix2dos.

        * djgpp/make.mak: beautify
        From Eli Zaretskii.

        * grep-2.1 release.

1997-09-01 Alain Magloire

        * grep-2.0f out for testing.

        * update to GNU gettext library from gettext-0.10.31

        * grep.c : have a nicer format for --version.
        Noted by Ulrich Drepper.

        * obstack.[ch]: updated from GNU C library
        * configure.in: look for stdlib.h [HAVE_STDLIB_H]
        Comments from Ulrich Drepper.

1997-08-25 Philippe De Muyter  <phdm@info.ucl.ac.be>

        * src/dfa.c (sys/types.h): File included unconditionnaly.

        * grep.c (long_options) [O_BINARY]: Add DOS-specific options.
        (fillbuf) [O_BINARY]: For DOS-style text files, strip CR
        characters at end of line.
        (prline) [O_BINARY]: Report correct byte offsets, even though CR
        characters were stripped when reading the file.
        (usage) [O_BINARY]: Add DOS-specific options.
        (setmatcher) [HAVE_SETRLIMIT]: Set re_max_failures so that the
        matcher won't ever overflow the stack.
        (main) [__MSDOS__, _WIN32]: Handle backslashes and drive letters
        in argv[0], remove the .exe suffix, and downcase the prgram name.
        [O_BINARY]: Pass additional DOS-specific options to getopt_long
        and handle them.  Call stat before attempting to open the file, in
        case it is a directory (DOS will fail the open call for
        directories).  Switch the input descriptor to binary mode, unless
        it is a terminal device.

        * system.h [O_BINARY]: Define macros to switch a handle to binary
        mode, so binary files could be grep'ed on MS-DOS and MS-Windows.
        [HAVE_SETLOCALE]: Test for HAVE_SETLOCALE instead of
        HAVE_LC_MESSAGES, to prevent compilation error in grep.c on
        systems which don't define HAVE_LC_MESSAGES, but have setlocale.

        * dosbuf.c: New file, functions specific for MS-DOS/MS-Windows.
        (guess_type, undossify_input, dossified_pos): New functions.

        New files, for building Grep with DJGPP tools for MS-DOS and
        MS-Windows.

        * grep.1: Document DOS-specific switches.

1997-08-08 Alain Magloire

        * grep-2.0e: available for testing

        * grep.c: change LC_MESSAGE to LC_ALL for (LC_CTYPE).
        Suggested by Jochen Hein.

        * ABOUT-NLS: updated.
        * grep.c: --version: more verbosity (COPYRIGHT).
        * grep.c: --help: PATTERN, FILE instead of <pattern>, <file>.
        * INSTALL.grep: not necessary removed.
        * configure.in: --disable-regex rename --without-include-regex.
        * THANKS: format: first row name, second email.
        * ChangeLog: format ISO 8601.
        Reported by Franc,ois Pinard.

        * grep.c: move dcl of struct stat st into "else" where it's used.
        Reported by Jim Meyering.

        * grep.c: totalnl should be %u in printf.
        Reported by Michael Aichlmay
        Corrected with guidance from Ulrich Drepper

1997-07-24 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

        * Makefile.am: corrected an error when installing {f,e}grep.1.
        From Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu>.
        From Ulrich Drepper <drepper@cygnus.com>.

        * Many files: use PARAMS instead of __STDC__ for prototypes.
        From Jim Meyering <meyering@eng.ascend.com>.
        Patch provided by Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu>.

        * dfa.[ch]: uses the one in gawk-3.0.3 with the patch from
        Arnold (see Changelog: July 12 1997)

        * grep.1: a note to say -l, -L, -q stop on first match.
        Noted by Andrew Beattie <gaffer@tug.com>.

        * grep.c: refuse to scan if the file is a directory.
        This was causing problems on SUNs. If the directory contains
        a file that could match the pattern, garbage was display.

        * tests directory: added new set of tests from Henry Spencer
        regex package. Change the way the tests were done to be more
        conformant to automake.

        * configure.in: added --disable-regex for folks with their own fuctions.

        * grep-20d : available for testing

1997-07-18 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

        * grep-2.0c: available for testing

1997-07-17 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

        * src/grep.c: Cause grep to fail if `fclose (stdout)' fails.
        From Jim Meyering <meyering@eng.ascend.com>.

        * grep.c:usage() more consistency in the --help.

        * egrep, fgrep were links This is in violation of GNU standards:
        "Please don't make the behavior of a utility depend on the name used
        to invoke it.  It is useful sometimes to make a link to a utility with
        a different name, and that should not change what it does."
        For now egrep and fgrep will be copies of grep. A better scheme
        should be found later.
        After discussion with Tom Tromey <tromey@cygnus.com>.

        * fgrep.man and egrep.man included: They are stubs that call grep.1.
        * Makefile.am: modified to install {f,e,}grep[,.1].

        * speed hack for -l, -L: bail out on first match.
        From Scott Weikart <scott@igc.apc.org>.

        * *.[ch]: provided prototypes for strict argument checking
        With the help of Stewart Levin <stew@sep.stanford.edu>.

1997-07-16 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

        * configure.in: typo in the creation of po/Makefile
        Noted by Volker Borchert bt@teknon.de.

        * grep-2.0b: make it available for testing.

1997-07-15 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

        * src/grep.c usage(): cut the --help in smaller printf()'s
        Noted by Ulrich Drepper <drepper@cygnus.com>.

1997-07-14 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

        * grep-2.0a: make an alpha available for testing.

        * dfa.c (test_bit, set_bit, clear_bit): Renamed from tstbit,
        setbit, clrbit to avoid conflict with HP-UX sys/param.h macros.

        * memchr.c: New file, from GNU libc.
        * grep.c (memchr): Remove definition.
        * configure.in: Use AC_REPLACE_FUNCS for memchr.

        portability boilerplate.

        * grep.c: Include sys/types.h once, instead of three times
        conditionally.
        * dfa.c, kwset.c, search.c: Include sys/types.h unconditionally,
        to always try to get size_t (needed on some old SysV's).

        * dfa.c: Define strchr in terms of index, not the other way around.
        * search.c: Use memcpy instead of bcopy.
