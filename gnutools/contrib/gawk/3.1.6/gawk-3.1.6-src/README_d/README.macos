The notes below no longer seem to apply.

============================

If you use GCC 4.0 under Mac OS X to compile gawk with optimization,
AND multibyte support is *disabled*, the `ignrcas2' test fails. This is
a compiler bug. Either compile it without optimization, or use gcc-3.3.

All the other tests pass.

Happily, the default is for the multibyte support to be enabled, so all
the tests pass by defualt.

============================

The `posix' test will fail because of output format differences but this
is apparently otherwise benign.

Gawk uses the system's mktime(3) routine, even though Autoconf thinks
it's broken, so Caveat Emptor.

If you ask me about either of these I will fuss at you for not having
done your homework.
