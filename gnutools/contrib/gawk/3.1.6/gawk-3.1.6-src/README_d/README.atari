See the README.1st file in the atari directory.

--------------------------------------------------------
Gawk on the Atari has been compiled and tested using gcc, both
with and without -mshort flag.  Other compilers can be used but if
sizeof(pointer) != sizeof(int) this code will not compile correctly
with a non-ANSI compiler (prototypes and library).

Compiled executables were tested and passed successfully a test suite
similar to 'make test'.  Required changes are minor and minor
modifications are due to differences in environment and/or shell.  If
a need will arise a modified test suite with a driving Makefile (for
gulam) is available on a request from Michal Jaegermann,
michal@gortel.phys.ualberta.ca or michal@ellpspace.math.ualberta.ca,
via e-mail.

Sample files atari/Makefile.st, atari/Makefile.awklib and
atari/config.h assume gcc compilation and execution under TOS; it is
likely that one would want to change it for another setup.  If they
are ok then copy atari/Makefile.st to Makefile, atari/config.h to
config.h and atari/Makefile.awklib to awklib/Makefile..  Pay attention
to code fragments bracketed by '#ifdef atarist ... #endif'.  These
modifications may not be required/desired with a different OS and/or
libraries.
