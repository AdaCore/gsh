Some Linux systems, notably RedHat systems through RedHat 4.1, have the
symbolic links for /dev/stdin and /dev/stdout messed up. Specifically,
/dev/stdin is linked to ../proc/self/fd/1 and /dev/stdout to
../proc/self/fd/0. This is backwards.  This causes strange behavior
when using those files from within gawk.

Removing and redoing the symlinks fixes the problem.  It is fixed in
post-4.1 RedHat Linux.

As of version 3.1 of gawk, this is no longer a problem, since gawk now
completely interprets the special file names internally.
