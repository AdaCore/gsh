GCC and Autoconf disagree about the type of the array argument passed
to getgroups(2).  You can thus ignore the warning that gcc will
generate under SunOS 4.1.x for io.c.

If you send me email about this without having read this file, I will
fuss at you!

The manyfiles test fails under SunOS 4.1.4.  There appears to be some
bug in libc (shared and static) for SunOS 4.1.4.  I got a working gawk
binary by linking in /usr/5lib/libc.a statically.
