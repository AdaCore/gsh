Solaris Problem #1:
===================

To: arnold@gnu.ai.mit.edu
Subject: Solaris 2.5.1 x86 bug in gawk-3.0.2

awktab.c has the following bogus logic:

#ifndef alloca
#ifdef __GNUC__
#define alloca __builtin_alloca
#else /* not GNU C.  */
#if (!defined (__STDC__) && defined (sparc)) || defined (__sparc__) || defined (__sparc) || defined (__sgi)
#include <alloca.h>
#else /* not sparc */

Solaris x86 obviously dosn't define sparc or __sparc.

What you _meant_ to say was:

if (defined(__sun) && defined(__SVR4))

(which identifies Solaris 2.x under both Sun's cc and gcc)

Solaris Problem #2:
===================

There is a known problem in that the `manyfiles' test will fail under
Solaris if you set your soft limit on the number of file descriptors to
above 256.  This is due to a "feature" of fdopen that an fd must be
less than 256 (see fdopen(3)).

IMHO this is Sun's problem, not mine.

Solution (a) to Problem #2:
===========================
Now fixed in the code via Paul Eggert's 2001-09-0 patch. See the
ChangeLog.

Dear Aharon:

Toda raba. Why don't you add something like that to README_d/README.solaris
file:

for the SunOS do in

/bin/sh:   ulimit -n 256; ulimit -a; make test
/bin/tcsh: limit descriptors 256; ulimit -a; make test

otherwise "make test" will fail

Shalom, Paul

Solaris Problem #3:
===================
Sun Feb  9 10:35:51 IST 2003

Certain versions of Sun C give compilation errors under Solaris 5.5, 5.6 and
possibly later.  Here's what I was told:

> We have this version of cc here:
> cc -V
> cc: Sun WorkShop 6 update 1 C 5.2 2000/09/11
> 
> Probably, the others use different combinations of OS and CC.
> A quick fix was this (we use csh-syntax here):
> 
> setenv CC "/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc -Xc"
> ./configure
> make check
