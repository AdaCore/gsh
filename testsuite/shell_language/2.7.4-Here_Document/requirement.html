<p>The redirection operators <tt>"&lt;&lt;"</tt> and <tt>"&lt;&lt;-"</tt> both
   allow redirection of lines contained in a shell input file, known as a 
   "here-document", to the input of a command.
</p>

<p>The here-document shall be treated as a single word that begins after the
   next &lt;newline&gt; and continues until there is a line containing only the
   delimiter and a &lt;newline&gt;, with no &lt;blank&gt;s in between. Then the
   next here-document starts, if there is one. The format is as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><b>[</b><i>n</i><b>]</b><tt>&lt;&lt;</tt><i>word
    here-document
delimiter</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>where the optional <i>n</i> represents the file descriptor number. If the
   number is omitted, the here-document refers to standard input (file
   descriptor 0).
</p>

<p>If any character in <i>word</i> is quoted, the delimiter shall be formed by performing quote removal on <i>word</i>,
and the
here-document lines shall not be expanded. Otherwise, the delimiter shall be the <i>word</i> itself.</p>

<p>If no characters in <i>word</i> are quoted, all lines of the here-document shall be expanded for parameter expansion, command
substitution, and arithmetic expansion. In this case, the backslash in the input behaves as the backslash inside double-quotes (see
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_02_03">Double-Quotes</a>). However, the double-quote character ( <tt>'"'</tt> ) shall not be treated specially
within a here-document, except when the double-quote appears within <tt>"$()"</tt>, <tt>"``"</tt>, or <tt>"${}"</tt>.</p>

<p>If the redirection symbol is <tt>"&lt;&lt;-"</tt>, all leading &lt;tab&gt;s shall be stripped from input lines and the line
containing the trailing delimiter. If more than one <tt>"&lt;&lt;"</tt> or <tt>"&lt;&lt;-"</tt> operator is specified on a line,
the here-document associated with the first operator shall be supplied first by the application and shall be read first
by the
shell.</p>
