=======================================
+ check basic descriptor duplication
.. create fd 2 that point to error.out
..   > status=0 (expect 0)
.. echo PASSED by duplicating fd 2 into 1
.. check that error.out contains PASSED
..   > PASSED
=======================================
+ check fd duplication 5>&word were word is a dynamic value
.. create fd 5 that point to file5.txt
..   > status=0 (expect 0)
.. echo PASSED to fd "`echo 5`" (that should evaluate to 5)
..   > status=0 (expect 0)
.. check content of file5
..   > PASSED
=======================================
+ check error handling on duplication of invalid fd
.. do an exec with invalid duplication
..   > status=1 (expect 1)
.. check that first redirection was executed (3>file3.txt)
..   > PASSED
.. check that third redirection was not executed (4>file4.txt)
..   > PASSED
..  check that none of the redirection are still in effect
..   > status=1 (expected 1 because of invalid fd)
..   > status=1 (expected 1 because of invalid fd)
=======================================
+ check that shell current command is not run in case of redirection error
.. launch subshell with bad fd duplication redirection
..   > status=1 (expected 1 because of invalid fd)
.. check that file should_not_be_here.txt does not exist
..   > PASSED (command was interrupted)
