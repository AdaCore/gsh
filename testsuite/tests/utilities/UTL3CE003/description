cp tests for investigating for [N820-022]

Actual issue was that 'base_name' from ada.directory
return the file name after removing also extensions.
gnat.directories_operations functions were used instead.
the corresponding test in the script is the one involving
'to_be_overwritten.txt'.

others tests in this script were investigations and
are kept to re-inforce the testing of 'cp' in several
situations.
